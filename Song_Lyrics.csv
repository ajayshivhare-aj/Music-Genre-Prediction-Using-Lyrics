0,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,The Calculation ,"You went into the kitchen cupboard, got yourself another hour
And you gave half of it to me
We sat there looking at the faces of these strangers in the pages
Till we knew 'em mathematically

They were in our minds until forever but we didn't mind
We didn't know better

So we made our own computer out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking while we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings and divided them up even
And it called that calculation perfect love

Didn't even know that love was bigger
Didn't even know that love was so, so
Hey, hey, hey

Hey this fire, it's burnin', burnin' us up
Hey this fire, it's burnin', burnin' us up

So we made the hard decision and we each made an incision
Past our muscles and our bones, saw our hearts were little stones
Pulled them out they weren't beating and we weren't even bleeding
As we lay them on the granite counter top

We beat 'em up against each other
We beat 'em up against each other
We struck 'em hard against each other
We struck 'em so hard, so hard until they sparked

Hey this fire, it's burnin', burnin' us up
Hey this fire, it's burnin', burnin' us up
Hey this fire, it's burnin', burnin' us up"
1,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,One More Time With Feeling ,"Your stitches are all out But your scars are healing wrong
And the helium balloon inside your room has come undone
And it's pushing up at the ceiling
And the flickering lights, it cannot get beyond

Everyone takes turns, now it's yours to play the part
And they're sitting all around you holding copies of your chart
And the misery inside their eyes is synchronized and reflecting it to yours

Hold on, one more time with feeling
Try it again, breathing's just a rhythm
Say it in your mind until you know that the words are right
This is why we fight

You thought by now you'd be so much better than you are
You thought by now they'd see that you had come so far
And the pride inside their eyes would
Synchronize into a love you'll never know
So much more than you can show

Hold on, one more time with feeling
Try it again, breathing's just a rhythm
Say it in your mind until you know that the words are right
This is why we fight, this is why we fight"
2,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,Man Of A Thousand Faces ,"The man of a thousand faces
Sits down at the table
Eats a small lump of sugar
And smiles at the moon like he knows her

And begins his quiet ascension
Without anyone's steady instruction
To a place and no religion
Has found a path to our alikeness

His words are quiet like stains
Are on a tablecloth washed in a river
Stains that are trying to cover for each other
Or at least blend in with the pattern

Good is better than perfect
Scrub till your fingers are bleeding
And I'm crying for things that
I tell others to do without crying

He used to go to his favorite bookstores
And rip out his favorite pages
And stuff 'em into his breast pockets
The moon to him was a stranger

Now he sits down at a table right next to the window
And begins his quiet ascension
Without anyone's steady instruction
To a place and no religion
Has found a path to our alikeness

And he eats a small lump of sugar
And smiles at the moon like he knows her"
3,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,The Flowers ,"The flowers you gave me are rotting
And still I refuse to throw them away
Some of the bulbs never opened quite fully
They might, so I'm waiting and staying awake

Things, I have loved, I'm allowed to keep
I'll never know if I go to sleep

The papers around me are piling and twisting
Regina, the paper back mummy, what then?
I'm taking in a knife to the books that I own
And I'm chopping and chopping
And boiling soup from stone

Things, I have loved, I'm allowed to keep
I'll never know if I go to sleep
Things, I have loved, I'm allowed to keep
I'll never know if I go to sleep"
4,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,Time Is All Around ,"You step on all my parts
And then you walk right out the door
And I know that your love
Ain't never coming back no more

Time is all around except inside my clock
Everybody's waiting for their lover to unlock

Leaves become most beautiful
When they're about to die
When they're about to fall from trees
When they're about to dry up

Time is all around, time is all around

I hallucinate a cat between my feet
I'm stepping lightly so as not to hurt it
Everybody wants to say that you have changed
Of course, you've changed
You've changed, you've changed
Your mind's been rearrange

But leaves become most beautiful
When they're about to die
When they're about to fall from trees
When they're about to dry up

Leaves become most beautiful
When they're about to die
When they're about to fall from trees
When they're about to dry up

Why am I supposed to love if I don't want to love?
Why am I supposed to? I'm so tired
Why am I supposed to love if I don't want to?
I don't want, I don't want to, I don't want

Leaves become most beautiful
When they're about to die
When they're about to fall from trees
When they're about to dry up

Leaves become most beautiful
When they're about to die
When they're about to fall from trees
When they're about to dry up"
5,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,The Sword & The Pen ,"Don't let me get out of this kiss, don't let me say what I say
The things that scare us today, what if they happen someday?
Don't let me out of your arms for now
What if the sword kills the pen? what if the God kills the man?
And if He does it with love, well, then it's death from above
And death from above is still a death

I don't want to live without you, I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live, I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live, I don't want to live without you

For those who still can recall, the desperate colors of fall
The sweet caresses of May, only in poems remain
No one recites them these days for the shame
So what if nothing is safe, so what if no one is saved
No matter how sweet, no matter how brave
What if each to his own lonely grave?

I don't want to live without you, I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live, I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live, I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live, I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live, I don't want to live without you"
6,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,Riot Gear ,"Wake up, put on my riot gear
But in the study of my house
I've got a smoking jacket passed to me from Grand Daddy
It's made of bow and arrow meat

Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do

Come home, take off my riot gear
Put on my smoke jacket
But in the library of my house I have a laugh
Medieval jokes are just as funny now if you've got a degree

Heaven help the ones who know
What makes the world go slow

Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock

The night comes, time to go on the town
And in my best Sashimi dress
And marble arch supporting shoes
I am a vision in my horse drawn tank

Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da

Stay out drinking into the night
And they are saying those same things
And I'm like, ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
'Til half past three and then it's time for me to go

Heaven help the ones who know
What makes the world go slow
What makes the world go slow

Come home, take off my tuna dress
Put on my collard greens
And in my sleep what dreams may come
Before I'm woken by alarms, put on my riot gear"

And I am one of your people but the cars don't stop

It's been a long time since before I've been touched
Now I'm getting touched all the time

9,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,Wallet ,"I found a wallet, I found a wallet
Inside were pictures of your small family
You were so young, your hair dark brown
You had been born in 1953

Your winter birthday was stamped on the plastic
Of a license so recently expired
I was so tired as I walked through my door
I let all the contents of your wallet on the floor

And like a holy relic or a mystery novel
I thumbed them in the dim light
Searching for a clue, a Blockbuster card
An old stick of Juicy Fruit
A crumpled receipt from a pair of leather boots

I have no wallet, I have no wallet
I keep my cards together with a blue rubber band
And with a free hand I search in my pocket
For pieces of, pieces of paper and change

I'll take your wallet to my local blockbuster
They'll find your number in their computer
You'll never know me, I'll never know you
But you will be so happy when they call you up"

11,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,Folding Chair ,"Come and open up your folding chair next to me
My feet are buried in the sand and there's a breeze
There is a shadow, you can't see my eyes
And the sea is just a wetter version of the skies

Let's get a silver bullet trailer and have a baby boy
I'll safety pin his clothes all cool and you'll graffiti up his toys
I've got a perfect body but sometimes I forget
I've got a perfect body 'cause my eyelashes catch my sweat
Yes they do, they do

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Now I've been sitting on this abandoned beach for years
Waiting for the salty water to cover up my ears
But every time the tide come in to take me home
I get scared, now I'm sitting here alone dreaming of the dolphin song

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Maybe one day you will understand
That I want nothing from you but to sweetly hold your hand
Till that day just please don't be so down
Don't make frowns, you silly clown

Just come and open up your folding chair next to me
My feet are buried in the sand and there's a breeze
There is a shadow, you can't see my eyes
And the sea is just a wetter version of the skies

There is a shadow, you can't see my eyes
There is a shadow, you can't see my eyes"
12,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,Genius Next Door ,"Some said the local lake had been enchanted
Others said it must have been the weather
The neighbors were trying to keep it quiet
But I swear that I could hear the laughter

So they joke and they nicknamed it 'The porridge'
'Cause over night that lake had turned as thick as butter
But the local kids would still go swimming, drinking
Saying that to them it doesn't matter

If you just hold in your breath till you come back up in full
Hold in your breath till you've thought it through, you fool

The genius next door was bussing tables
Wiping clean the ketchup bottle labels
Getting high and mumbling German fables
Didn't care as long as he was able

To strip his clothes off by the dumpsters
At night while every one was sleeping
And wade midway into that porridge
Just him and the secret, he was keeping

If you just hold in your breath till you come back up in full
Hold in your breath till you've thought it through, you foolish child

In the morning the film crews start arriving
With donuts, coffee and reporters
The kids were waking up hung over
The neighbors were starting up their cars

The garbageman were emptying the dumpsters
Atheists were praying full of sarcasm
And the genius next door was sleeping
Dreaming that the antidote is orgasm

If you just hold in your breath till you come back up in full
Hold in your breath till you've thought it through, you foolish child"
13,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,Laughing With ,"No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one's laughing at God
When they're starving or freezing or so very poor

No one laughs at God
When the doctor calls after some routine tests
No one's laughing at God
When it's gotten real late and their kid's not back from the party yet

No one laughs at God
When their airplane starts to uncontrollably shake
No one's laughing at God
When they see the one they love hand in hand with someone else
And they hope that they're mistaken

No one laughs at God
When the cops knock on their door
And they say we got some bad news, sir
No one's laughing at God
When there's a famine or fire or flood

But God could be funny
At a cocktail party when listening to a good God themed joke or
Or when the crazies say He hates us
And they get so red in the head you think they're 'bout to choke

God could be funny
When told he'll give you money if you just pray the right way
And when presented like a genie who does magic like Houdini
Or grants wishes like Jiminy Cricket and Santa Claus
God can be so hilarious

No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one's laughing at God
When they've lost all they've got and they don't know what for

No one laughs at God
On the day they realize that the last sight they'll ever see
Is a pair of hateful eyes
No one's laughing at God
When they're saying their goodbyes

But God could be funny
At a cocktail party when listening to a good God themed joke or
Or when the crazies say He hates us
And they get so red in the head you think they're 'bout to choke

God could be funny
When told he'll give you money if you just pray the right way

14,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,Blue Lips ,"He stumbled into faith and thought, God this is all there is
The pictures in his mind arose and began to breathe
And all the Gods and all the worlds
Began colliding on a backdrop of blue

Blue lips, blue veins

He took a step but then felt tired, he said I'll rest a little while
But when he tried to walk again he wasn't a child
And all the people hurried fast, real fast
And no one ever smiled

Blue lips, blue veins
Blue, the color of our planet from far, far away
Blue lips, blue veins
Blue, the color of our planet from far, far away

He stumbled into faith and thought, God this is all there is
The pictures in his mind arose and began to breathe
And no one saw and no one heard, they just followed lead
The pictures in his mind awoke and began to breed

They started out, beneath the knowledge tree
And they chopped it down to make white picket fences
And marching along the railroad tracks
They smile real wide for the camera lenses
They made it past the enemy lines
Just to become enslaved in the assembly lines

Blue lips, blue veins
Blue, the color of our planet from far, far away
Blue lips, blue veins
Blue, the color of our planet from far, far away

Blue, the most human color
Blue, the most human color
Blue, the most human color

Blue lips, blue veins
Blue, the color of our planet from far, far away"
15,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,Eet ,"It's like forgetting the words to your favorite song
You can't believe it, you were always singing along
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember, you try to feel the beat

Eet, eet, eet
Eet, eet, eet

You spend half of your life trying to fall behind
You're using your headphones to drown out your mind
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember, you try to move your feet

Eet, eet, eet
Eet, eet, eet

Someone's deciding whether or not to steal
He opens a window just to feel the chill
He hears that outside a small boy just started to cry
'Cause it's his turn, but his brother won't let him try

It's like forgetting the words to your favorite song
You can't believe it, you were always singing along
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember, you try to move your feet

It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember, you try to feel the beat"
16,Folk,Regina Spektor,Far ,Machine ,"My eyes are bifocal, my hands are sub jointed
I live in the future in my pre-war apartment
And I count all my blessings, I have friends in high places
And I'm upgraded daily, all my wires without traces

Hooked into machine, hooked into machine
Hooked into machine, I'm hooked into, hooked into
Hooked into machine, hooked into machine
Hooked into machine, I'm hooked into, hooked into machine

I collect my moments into a correspondence
With a mightier power who just lacks my perspectives
And who lacks my organics and who covets my defects
And I'm downloaded daily, I am part of a composite

Hooked into machine, hooked into machine
Hooked into machine, I'm hooked into, hooked into
Hooked into machine, hooked into machine
Hooked into machine, I'm hooked into, hooked into machine

Everything's provided, consummate consumer
Part of worldly taking, apart from worldly troubles
Living in your pre-war apartment, soon to be your post-war apartment
And you live in the future and the future, it's here, it's bright, it's now"

Oh, what an honor

Human, human of the year, you are
Human, human of the year, you are

Why are you so scared?
You stand there shaking in the pew
The icons are whispering to you

They're just old men
Like on the benches in the park
Except their balding spots are glistening with gold

Human, human of the year, you are
Human, human of the year, you are

Ah, ah, ah, you have won
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Outside the cars are beeping out a song
Just in your honor
And although they do not know it
All mankind are now your brothers

And thus the cathedral had spoken
Wishing well to all the sinners
And with a sigh grew silent
Until next year's big human winner

Outside the cars are beeping out a song
Just in your honor
And although they do not know it
All mankind are now your brothers
All mankind are now your brothers

Hallelujah, hallelujah

Two birds of a feather
Say that they're always gonna stay together
But one's never going to let go of that wire

I have chose the long road
That leads me out to god knows
So I can't stop right now

Even the good stars can fall from grace and falter
Lose their faith and slide
But I can't get an ocean that's deep enough

For my day, it's the first of the ascension
It's a sad way we've flown after the storm
And her last words were, ""I'm always thinking of you""
In my golden days I was a slave

Well now it's time for to sound your voice
And capture what you're after
My ship was sold right up the river
But I'm not going down here

This journey isn't over
It's a long way to the house of Fitzcarraldo
And her last words were, ""I was only thinking of you""
In my golden days I was a saint

Even the good stars can fall from grace and falter
Like lapdogs that stride that mystery
And her last words were, ""I'll see you down in history""
It's the only way that we can go

I shall eclipse you

It's a long way to Fitzcarraldo
And I don't want to pray for you"

You see, you're just like everyone
When the shit falls all you want to do is run away and hide all by yourself
When you're far from me, there's nothing else

When your mind's made up

I knew that I would
I want to be missed by somebody good
Don't wanna come back
'Til I think that I should
To somebody good

To dig through the dirt
To find what was lost
To sift through the hurt

Do you think that I could
I want to belong to somebody good

I wanna return

But I want you all the more for that
And words fall through me
And always fool me and I can't react

And games that never amount
To more than they're meant
Will play themselves out

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice
You've made it now

Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I can't go back
Moods that take me and erase me
And I'm painted black

You have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you had a choice
You've made it now

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you had a choice
You've made it now

Falling slowly, sing your melody
I'll sing along"

And as for all assumptions made
And questions never asked

I know we're not where I promised you we'd be by now
But maybe it's a question of who'd want it anyhow

Even now the rainbows seem closer to your hand
Doesn't know where to stop the measure of a man

Okay we're not what i promised you we would become
But maybe its a question of how much you really want

Had enough?
Had enough?
There's plenty more where that came from now

Feeling bored
Swallowed up
We got hours on you now

Here, stay around

Working this out

But it's not just this
It's everything
You're so hard to reach
And impossible to really read
When your talking with
Two tongues in your mouth
And I wish you'd quit this muttering
Beneath your breath
It's killing me
You've not said nothing yet

Who's talking now?
Well I guess I'm starting to doubt
Are we lost here?
Are you keeping count?
Are you just gonna let me down?

Well your heart's not in it
It's everywhere
It's plain to see
You're still wondering
What's underneath
You're so curious
It's two strikes and you're out
And I'm tiring of this attitude
How you fall to pieces
Like you do
I can't believe you're still talking
With two tongues in your mouth
After all we've been around

Will you hear me out?
You're the only thing

You gave your heart to the ones you knew
And at the dawn of every day
There was a light that you gave to me

You gave yourself to a love that conquers
Give everything to a love that conquers

And then you came and you came real close
You gave the heart what it wanted most
You took your time and you made it clear
Maybe time will erase some things

You ran away with a love that conquers
You ran away with a love that conquers

Too long in the shadows, too long in the dust
Give yourself to a love that conquers"

Forgive me, Lover, for I have sinned
For I have loved you wrong.

But this estranged organ in my chest
Still beats for you
It will not rest, so
Meet me in our secret place
When the time has come

Rest your head in my lap and I'll 
And I'll lead you out of your own trap
And I'll show you how much
You have missed through the
Time we weren't right

Ah...
Ah...

So forgive me, lover, for I have sinned
For I have let you go.

Keep us sliding back to where we were

Will tell you that you walked away with it

Your words just rattle my head

And I can't make this make sense

I cannot take it I'm out
I'm stuck here kidding myself
You're out there caring somewhere

What's the verb to
Kick it off to
Take the time and walk away from it
I'm not playing,
That'll never sit with us well
We're far too pious to get out of it
And we're on our way

We were never quite like this
We've gone as far as we can go
Without crashing

At the heart in every fool is the hope you're stupid too
And there's this lingering, this lingering feeling

Paper saint will you hear her when she calls
You got no dog in this fight

Take this offering from her hands
This simple trail back to the light

Beneath the pressure of all time
They grow in hope and expectation
Waiting for your hands to find
Cause only you could reach inside me
And figure out the worth
Of a life I lived providing
What it was you needed most

And if everything is measured by the hole it leaves behind
Then this mountain has been leveled
And there's no more diamonds in the mine
Go on now just leave it
The timing wasn't right
And the force that swept us both away
Was too strong for us to fight

Fantasy Man you are always one step ahead of me
Well I never heard the warning
I haven't got things right
Yet the sun came out this morning
And filled my room with light

So go on now, you are forgiven
Let's put it down to life
The story of two lovers
Who danced both edges of the knife

In the station you're standing
Not knowing what you want
And the secrets we're defending
Have become our only bond

Just be patient while I wait here
Our journey is out of sync
While you're out there running in the chaos
I need some time to think

Fantasy Man you are always one step ahead of me
Well I never heard the warnings
I haven't got things right
Yet the sun came out this morning 
And filled my room with light

So go on now, you are forgiven
Let's put it down to life
The story of two lovers
Who danced both edges of the knife"

To beat up all your friends
Every chink in the armor
An excuse to cause offense

And the boys from the hallway
Calling out your name
And true love
Will find them in the end

You were restless
I was somewhere less secure
So I went running to the road

And so now there's
A long list of places I was
I quit my rambling and came home

'Cause maybe I was born
To hold you in these arms
Maybe I was born
To hold you in these arms

Use your saints and your mantra
And your things to keep you calm
If you stay with that asshole
He's gonna do you harm

There's a voice singing loudly
On the radio just for you
And good fortune
Will find him in the end

Maybe I was born
To hold you in these arms
Maybe I was born
To hold you in these arms

Maybe I was born
To hold you in these arms

To pack a bag
To head out on the road
To take away what I know is mine

And I'm running down
Past the yellow house
With Joe into the breeze
Where no one seems to care

And I'm feeling the pull
Dragging me off again
And I'm feeling so small
Against the sky tonight

Well stories of an open line
And every time we work ourselves up into a rage

We smash and grab we pull the handle no one says
But everyone wants to be the one just climbing out

And I'm feeling the pull
Dragging me on again
And I'm feeling so small
Against that big moon sky tonight"

For it's been so long since I have seen you
I can hardly remember your face anymore

When I get really lonely
And the distance causes only silence
I think of you smiling
With pride in your eyes
A lover that sighs

If you want me
Satisfy me
If you want me
Satisfy me

Are you really sure that you'd believe me?
When others say I lie
I wonder if you could ever despise me
When you know I really try
To be a better one to satisfy you
For you're everything to me
And I'll do what you ask me
If you'll let me be free

If you want me
Satisfy me

So



So you make a little money
Off of somebody else's sweat
So some people starve a little
While you get fat
While you get fat 

So you grind and grind
And you push and shove
And claim that those most worthy
Will get what they deserve
What they deserve

It can't be true
It can't be true
Because I've seen too many hungry faces
I've seen too many with the likes of you
It can't be true

For you everything has it's price
You give nothing away for free
If silence were truly golden
I guess no one could sleep
No one could sleep 

You have money at your fingertips
People at your beck and call
And you're fool enough
To think for a price
You can have the whole wide world 

For all our sake's
And all our lives
We must hope the words
That come from your lips
We must hope those words are lies 

For all our sake's
And all our lives
We must hope the dreams
Soulless visions that you have
Are never realized 

So
You've got a big house
And you drive a fancy car
So what if your pockets are full
If you have an empty heart 

You snap your fingers
And all the waters part
So what if the people bow down
If they show you no regard 

Your left hand
Always watches your right
So what if you trust in God
If you can't sleep at night 

You think you've made it
You think you've got what everyone wants
So what if you're a big fat man
With an empty little heart 

Who has made a little money
Off of somebody else's sweat
Who watched the people starve
While you got fat
While you got fat
You got fat
You got fat"

Smoke And Ashes



I'd heard rumors and I'd heard talk
About the trail you'd left of broken hearts
About the sea of tears too wide to cross
But a little bad press has never scared me off
So I burned a path to figure out
How to get me some of what you got

I've got a red hot heart
If the talk is true your's is the same
And we should be together
And let our passions fan love's flame

When I looked for you I almost passed you by
You were so cool and calm I thought my friends had lied
But I thought so much reserve must make you wild inside
It was there and then that I knew I had to get some of what you got

I've got a red hot heart
If the talk is true your's is the same
And we should be together
And let our passions fan love's flame

I thought I'd won your heart when I held you hand in mine
I thought it was true love the way we complemented each other
But my right is your wrong
And when you're right then I'm left with nothing
Your light and your heat have all been spent
Leaving only smoke and ashes
Only smoke and ashes baby

I've got a red hot heart
Any your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say there's fire down below
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby

I'm crying all the time
Salty stinging tears
And mourning for the past carbon-dated years
But knowing now for certain that you were always right
Because if a breeze could blow you out of my life
It's only smoke and ashes baby
Only smoke and ashes baby

I've got a red hot heart
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say there's fire down below
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby

I was blinded by devotion
My unwavering love for you
So blinded that I thought all your lies were true
But now I know for certain since you've gone away
It was just a smoldering fire I mistook for a blaze
Only smoke and ashes baby

I've got a red hot heart
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say there's fire down below
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby
Only smoke and ashes baby, baby ..."

Remember The Tinman



There are locks on the doors
And chains stretched across all the entries to the inside
There's a gate and a fence
And bars to protect from only God knows what lurks outside

Who stole your heart left you with a space
That no one and nothing can fill 
Who stole your heart who took it away
Knowing that without it you can't live

Who took away the part so essential to the whole
Left you a hollow body
Skin and bone
What robber what thief who stole your heart and the key

Who stole your heart 
The smile from your face
The innocence the light from your eyes
Who stole your heart or did you give it away
And if so then when and why

Who took away the part so essential to the whole
Left you a hollow body
Skin and bone
What robber what thief
Who stole your heart and the key 

Now all sentiment is gone
Now you have no trust in no one 

Who stole your heart
Did you know but forget the method and moment in time
Was it a trickster using mirrors and sleight of hand
A strong elixir or a potion that you drank

Who hurt your heart
Bruised it in a place
That no one and nothing can heal 
You've gone to wizards, princes and magic men
You've gone to witches, the good the bad the indifferent

But still all sentiment is gone
But still you have no trust in no one 

If you can tear down the walls
Throw your armor away remove all roadblocks barricades
If you can forget there are bandits and dragons to slay
And don't forget that you defend an empty space

And remember the tinman
Found he had what he thought he lacked
Remember the tinman
Go find your hear and take it back 

Who stole your heart
Maybe no one can say
One day you will find it I pray"

Nothing Yet



Good times and bad
Seen them both
Hope fly out the window
Fortune walk through the door
Learned not to believe
This is as good as it gets
Because we ain't seen nothing yet 

Hands untied
But the same shuffle once again
Running all the time
Ain't going nowhere
It's a new page in the same book
It's a new game with the same rules
The lights go down
Fade to black on the set
And we ain't seen nothing yet 

Saddled with bonds
Broken and in disrepair
Forty acres to a forty-ounce
Don't seem fair
The sirens rise and wail
Shadowed by Liberty's torch
As the boats that brought us over
Are slowly sinking off the shore
And we ain't seen nothing yet 

This life a crime
A blessing and a curse
Chosen and unwanted
Displaced and usurped
I'd run away
But there is nowhere to go
So I'll stand and fight
And hope and pray
That the best is yet to come
And we ain't seen nothing yet"

Now don't get me wrong - I love life and living

All wrong
You see we need to change it now, this world with too few happy endings
We can resolve to start all over make a new beginning

Start all over

The world is broken into fragments and pieces
That once were joined together in a unified whole
But now too many stand alone - There's too much separation
We can resolve to come together in the new beginning

Start all over
Start all over
Start all over
Start all over

We can break the cycle - We can break the chain
We can start all over - In the new beginning
We can learn, we can teach
We can share the myths the dream the prayer
The notion that we can do better
Change our lives and paths
Create a new world and

In matters of the heart 

I won't call it love
But it feels good to have passion in my life
If there's a battle
I hope my head always defers to my heart
In matters of the heart 

I guess I'm crazy to think
I can give you what you don't want
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart 

I wish that I had the power
To make these feelings stop
I lose all self control
In matters of the heart

I can't believe
It's so hard to find someone
To give affection to
And from whom you can receive
I guess it's just the draw of the cards
In matters of the heart 

You caught me off guard
Somehow you reached me
Where I thought I had nothing left inside
I've learned my lesson I've been edified
In matters of the heart 

I've spent my nights
Where the sleeping dogs lie
Not by your side
It feels so lonely
Once again I've left to much to chance
In matters of the heart 

Here I sit
I'm feeling sorry for myself
It's quite a sight
But I have you to thank
For reminding me
We're all alone in this world
And in matters of the heart 

I'm already missing you
Although we won't say good-byes
Until tomorrow afternoon
Maybe when and if I see you again
We'll see eye to eye
In matters of the heart 

I have no harsh words for you
I have no tears to cry
If the moon were full
I'd be howling inside
It only hurts
In matters of the heart 

If today were my birthday
I'd be reborn
As Bronte's bird a bird that could fly
And all accounts would be settled
In matters of the heart

You in your fancy 
Material world 
Don't see the links of chain 
Binding blood 


Our own ancestors 
Are hungry ghosts 
Closets so full of bones 
They won't close 


Call it upward mobility 
But you've been sold down the river 
Just another form of slavery 
And the whole man-made white world 
Is your master 


You in your fancy 
Material world 
Create in your own image 
A supreme god 


Your virgin mary 
Your holy ghosts 
Claimed to be pure of heart 
Have hands that are stained with blood 


You in your fancy

Don't see the links of chain 
Binding"

Let It Rain



Let it rain
As I walk these streets unknown
To no one named
Not even myself
When I'm low

Give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most
Give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most

Let it go
No mother no father no home
Forget as all others
Have forgotten
When I'm alone

But give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most
Give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most

Let it come
Love that lifts me up
Pain that brings me down
Everything I'd ever want and don't
When I'm not strong

But give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most
Give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most

Let it rain
Let it flood these streets and wash me away
To where it makes no difference who I am
Or what the future holds 
When I don't know

But give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most
Give me hope
That help is coming

Less Than Strangers



You and me
Had some history
Had a semblance of honesty
All that has changed now
We shared words
Only lover speak
How can it be
We are less than strangers 

Oh it hurts to lose in love
Let anger and cruelty win
It's unfair that you doubt your feelings
And that you'll ever love again
I know that hearts can change
Like the seasons and the wind
But when I said forever
I thought that we'd always be friends 

You and me had some history
Had a semblance of honesty
All that has changed now
We shared words
Only lovers speak
How can it be
We are less than strangers 

I thought I saw you yesterday
I thought I passed you on the street
I swear I saw your face
I was not imagining
That you stole a glance my way
You walked away from me
My heart it may be broken
But my eyes are dry to see 

You and me had some history
Had a semblance of honesty
All that has changed now
We shared words
Only lovers speak
How can it be
We are less than strangers"

I'll try to keep the walls from falling down
You can be beautiful and fabulous

I can't reach the pain you feel
But I'll try to keep the walls from falling down
If you can hold on
Lose your fear
I'll try to keep the walls from falling down

To bring you peace

Subcity



People say it doesn't exist 
'Cause no one would like to admit 
That there is a city underground 
Where people live everyday 
Off the waste and decay 
Off the discards of their fellow man 


Here in subcity life is hard 
We can't receive any government relief 
I'd like to please give Mr. President my honest regards 
For disregarding me 


They say there's too much crime in these city streets 
My sentiments exactly 
Government and big business hold the purse strings 
When I worked I worked in the factories 
I'm at the mercy of the world 
I guess I'm lucky to be alive 


They say we've fallen through the cracks 
They say the system works 
But we won't let it 
Help 
I guess they never stop to think 
We might not just want handouts 
But a way to make an honest living 
Living this ain't living 


What did I do deserve this 
Had my trust in god 
Worked everyday of my life 
Thought I had some guarantees 
That's what I thought 
At least that's what I thought 


Last night I had another restless sleep 
Wondering what tomorrow might bring 
Last night I dreamed 
A cold blue light was shining down on me 
I screamed myself awake 
Thought I must be dying 
Thought I must be dying"

That's when Billy would take me walkin'
A through the back yard, we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes, Lord knows, to my surprise

Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation

Sitting around waiting for a promotion

And get their share
Poor people gonna rise up

Why do the babies starve
When there's enough food to feed the world
Why when there're so many of us
Are there people still alone 

Why are the missiles called peace keepers
When they're aimed to kill
Why is a woman still not safe
When she's in her home 

Love is hate
War is peace
No is yes
And we're all free 

But somebody's gonna have to answer
The time is coming soon
Admidst all these questions and contradictions
There're some who seek the truth 

But somebody's gonna have to answer
The time is coming soon
When the blind remove their blinders
And the speechless speak the truth"

For you I don the veil
By your light
Others pale by comparison
I place my faith in love
My fate in this communication 

I've been having dreams and visions
In them you are always standing

To see your arms extending
Outstretched towards me 

To you I give my pledge
I honor all that's good
In this life we're living
To think not only of myself
But of the greater union 

Can I get a witness
There is salvation and rapture for the lonely
Can I get a witness

Come gather round people wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you'd better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a changing

Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pens
And keep your eyes WIDE, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, FOR the wheel's still in spin
And there's no telling who that it's naming
FOR the loser will be later to win
For the times, they are a changing

Come senators, congressmen, please head the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be HE WHO has stalled
The battle outside ragging will soon shake your windows
And rattle your WALLS
For the times, they are a changing

Come mothers and fathers THROUGH OUT THE land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughter are beyond your command
Your old role is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend YOUR hand
For the times they are a changing

The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast

AS the present now will LATER be the past

With cities of concrete and steel
But there is no glory no honor

Less understanding?

To make your everyday life

A fabrication of a grand scheme
Where I am the scary monster
I eat the city and as I leave the scene
In my spaceship I am laughing
In your remembrance of your bad dream
There's no one but you standing 

Leave the pity and the blame
For the ones who do not speak
You write the words to get respect and compassion
And for posterity
You write the words and make believe
There is truth in the space between 

There is fiction in the space between

Give us one more sad sordid story

Make me fall
Make my heart stop and start
To tremble uncontrollably
Let my eyes see fear make desire
Keep those who long apart
Forbid the kiss
And leave us innocent
Of the things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark

Make me remember
Make me forget
Make my mind unable
To force the body to do its will
Let it be right for belief and denial
To share a space in the heart and leave us only to imagine
About the things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

Make me pretend
Make me expect
Things can go and come to pass
Without trial or tribulation
Let this life space and time
Leave my body with permanent marks
Faded scars and lines
But not a single impression
Of the things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

Let me be tempted
Let me be torn
But make my thoughts pure and not
Morally corrupt in form
Let us sleep tonight
Let innocence lie in our dreams and secret hearts
With burning desire

The things some do in the dark

And wake up with cold sweat
Coming through my pores 

Why don't I dream anymore

I hold it in my hand
I open it up

All the trees bear fruit
I have to pick them before they fall
I finally grab one
I hold it in my hand
I open it up
It's rotten to the core 

Why don't I dream anymore 

If these are the things that
Dreams are made of

At This Poing In My Life



Done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right
Oh I, Oh I've
Done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right 

At this point in my life
I've done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right
If you put your trust in me I hope I won't let you down
If you give me a chance I'll try

You see it's been a hard road the road I'm traveling on
And if I take your hand I might lead you down the path to ruin
I've had a hard life I'm just saying it so you'll understand
That right now, right now, I'm doing the best I can 
At this point in my life

At this point in my life
Although I've mostly walked in the shadows
I'm still searching for the light
Won't you put your faith in me
We both know that's what matters
If you give me a chance I'll try

You see I've been climbing stairs but mostly stumbling down
I've been reaching high always losing ground
You see I've been reaching high but always losing ground
You see I've conquered hills but I still have mountains to climb
And right now right now I'm doing the best I can
At this point in my life 

Before we take a step
Before we walk down that path
Before I make any promises
Before you have regrets
Before we talk commitment
Let me tell you of my past
All I've seen and all I've done
The things I'd like to forget 
At this point in my life

At this point in my life
I'd like to live as if only love mattered
As if redemption was in sight
As if the search to live honestly
Is all that anyone needs
No matter if you find it 

You see when I've touched the sky
The earth's gravity has pulled me down
But now I've reconciled that in this world
Birds and angels get the wings to fly
If you can believe in this heart of mine
If you can give it a try
Then I'll reach inside and find and give you
All the sweetness that I have
At this point in my life

At this point in my life"

Trouble won't find me
Sorrow won't call
Sadness will turn away
Searching for a new soul
Hardship won't come by
All pain will cease
Somebody will take my place
And suffer for me

If I never see another sun
If I never see another sun
If I never see another sun
Another sun another sun

If no love will comfort me
If no kind words come
To offer hope or peace
When I have fallen
If I be a stranger
Friend of no one
I'll gladly take my place 
In the world beyond

If I never see another sun
If I never see another sun
If I never see another sun
Another sun another sun

If I lay down and wake to see
The bright light of the morn
Rise up every day
To blind beat and burn
Show me no mercy
For need or want
Let somebody take my place
When the new day dawns

If I never see another sun

Oh my mama told me 
'Cause she say she learned the hard way 
Say she wanna spare the children 
She say don't give or sell your soul away 
'Cause all that you have is your soul 


Don't be tempted by the shiny apple 
Don't you eat of a bitter fruit 
Hunger only for a taste of justice 
Hunger only for a world of truth 
'Cause all that you have is your soul 


I was a pretty young girl once 
I had dreams I had high hopes 
I married a man he stole my heart away 
He gave his love but what a high price I paid 
And all that you have is your soul 


Why was I such a young fool 
Thought I'd make history 
Making babies was the best I could do 
Thought I'd made something that could be mine forever 
Found out the hard way one can't possess another 
And all that you have is your soul 


I thought thought that I could find a way 
To beat the system 
To make a deal and have no debts to pay 
I'd take it all take it all I'd run away 
Me for myself first class and first rate 
But all that you have is your soul 


Here I am waiting for a better day 
A second chance 
A little luck to come my way 
A hope to dream a hope that I can sleep again 
And wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands 
'Cause all that you have is your soul 


All that you have 
All that you have 
All that you have 
Is your soul"

Someday we make this a long time thing

Seem like waiting is all I do 
Don't say you won't come back to me 
And make me have to go aout chasing after you 
We get in a fight 
You stay out late 
You have no idea 
How much you make me worry baby 
Called everyone in town 
I think you know 
So come on now 
Come on come on 
Back home 


Baby sweet baby

But I still got my pride too

I'll suffer for my heart 
Then I'll go find someone to worry about me

Touched the mirror
Broke the surface of the water
Saw my true self
All illusions shattered 

Money's only paper only ink
We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree
How the world turns
Who made the sun
Who owns the sea
The world we know will fall piece by piece 

Sat down up close to the colored black hole
Like they'd always told me not to
Saw the one dimension polka dot pacifier
And all illusions shattered

How the world turns
Who made the sun
Who owns the sea
The world we know will fall piece by piece 

Bared myself wholly heart and body unadorned
Stripped down solely
To the evil and the good
Felt no shame
Naked to the world
And all illusions shattered

We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree
How the world turns

Faced towards the sea
Looked to heaven up above
Felt the world revolve around me
No one could tell me otherwise
But the turbulent waters won't reflect this life
Only the sun the moon and sky
And all illusions shattered

Unsung Psalm
There would be psalms sung by a choir
I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired
I'd be at peace and I'd have no desire
If I'd lived right 

There would be cherubs with tiny harps arrows and bows
I'd have a halo and a flowing white robe
I'd be enfolded by a celestial light
If I'd lived right 

But I'm feeling hot and bothered under the collar
I feel the sweat breaking out on my brow
I feel the heat and I know it's the passion
The love I can't disavow 

If this is a dream wake me up now
If this is a movie let's edit these scenes out
It would be a PG instead of an X-rated life
If I'd lived right 

Some would call me a cheat call me a liar
Say that I've been defeated by the basest desired
Yes I have strayed and succumbed to my vices
But I tried to live right 

But I have no regrets no guilt in my heart
I only feel sadness for any pain that I've caused
I guess I wouldn't bother to worry at all
If I'd lived right 

Do you live by the book do you play by the rules?
Do you care what is thought by others about you?
If this day is all that is promised to you
Do you life for the future the present the past? 

If there is one thing I know I know I will die
If anyone cares some stranger my critique my life
I may be revered or defamed and decried
But I tried to live right

I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired
I'd be at peace and I'd have no desire

Cold Feet
There was a little boy once upon a time 
Who in spite of his young age and small size knew his mind 
For every copper penny and clover he would find 
Make a wish for better days the end of hard times 
For no more cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet 
His clothes were always clean 
His face was always scrubbed 
There was food on the table enough to fill him up 
His house was full of life His house was full of love 
But when winter days arrived 
There was never money enough to shod his cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He grew up to be a worker determined to succeed 
He made a life for himself, free from worldly wants or needs 
But with nobody to share the life he'd made 
No body to keep him warm at night 
When he'd go to sleep he'd sleep alone with his cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet 

One night he walked the street looking to the heaven's above 
Searching for a shooting star a benevolent God 
When a woman passing by brushed his arm 
He turned and found love 
He then wished for the courage to ask this stranger 
Who she was to not have cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He thought she'd like the party life and want the finer things 
So he promised more than he could buy 
And he promised her the sun and moon to not have cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He worked day and night his fingers to the bone 
Hi worried mind guilty conscience drive him on 
He can't give her what she needs 
He wants to give her what he thinks she wants 
Her sad-eyed face, his empty pockets drive him on and his cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He'd struggled all his life to be an honest man 
Proud that the dirt on his palms was the soil of the land 
But some guys he knew from high school days 
Said they had a plan to get rich quick 
And they could count him in if he don't have cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He thought about their offer accepted it without qualms 
Dreamt about the life he'd buy 
The comfort that would come without cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He decided to tell his wife things would soon turn around 
He said the little boy is dead 
A man stands with you now without cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet 
Without cold feet - Cold cold cold cold feet 

He thought he'd set his clock right - He though he'd read his watch 
He left in such a hurry he didn't think to wish for luck 
Makes no difference if you're early - No difference if you're late 
When you're out of time - The flowers have been laid 
You're six feet underground 
With cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet"

Behind The Wall
Last night I heard the screaming
Loud voices behind the wall
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call
The police
Always come late
If they come at all

And when they arrive
They say they can't interfere
With domestic affairs
Between a man and his wife
And as they walk out the door
The tears well up in her eyes

Last night I heard the screaming
Then a silence that chilled my soul
I prayed that I was dreaming
When I saw the ambulance in the road

And the policeman said
""I'm here to keep the peace
Will the crowd disperse
I think we all clould use some sleep"""

And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And God I know I'm one

My mother she's a tailor
She sews those new bluejeans
My father he's a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he's ever satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Oh mother tell your children
Not to do as I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And God I know I'm one"

Happy



Should be happy to be loved
Happy to be
Unburdened by the thought
I could still be lonely
I think you're the one
Everyone agrees
But some can see the face of love 
And turn away in disbelief

Every time we get close
I just run
And the wind on my face
Last rays of the sun
Shine on my skin
My heart slow me down
Is all that I can feel
All that I can feel
All that I can feel
All that I can feel

Should be happy to be loved
Happy to be
With someone who knows
And understands me
I think you're the one
Everyone agrees
But some can touch the hand of love 
And pull away in disbelief

Every time we get close
I just run
And the wind on my face
Last rays of the sun
Shine on my skin
My heart slow me down
Is all that I can feel
All that I can feel
All that I can feel
All that I can feel

Should be happy to be loved
Happy to be
Possessed by nothing but
A heart that's chosen freely
I think you're the one
Everyone agrees
But some can feel the grace of love 
And walk away in disbelief

Every time we get close
I just run
And the wind on my face
Last rays of the sun
Shine on my skin
My heart slow me down
Is all that I can feel
All that I can feel
All that I can feel

They throwed him in jail 
And they kept him there 
Hoping soo he'd die 
That his body and spirit would waste away 
And soon after that his mind 


But every day is born a fool 
One who thinks that he can rule 
One who says tomorrow's mine 
One who wakes one day to find 
The prison doors open the shackles broken 
And chaos in the street 


Everybody sing we're free free free free 
Everybody sing we're free free free free 
Everybody sing we're free free free free 


They throwed him in jail 
And they kept him there 
Hoping his memory'd die 
That the people forget how he once led 
And fought for justice in their lives 


But every day is born a man 
Who hates what he can't understand 
Who thinks the answer is to kill 
Who thinks his actions are god's will 


And he thinks he's free free free free 
Yes he thinks he's free free free free 
He thinks he's free free free free 


Soon must come the day 
Whe the righteous have their way 
Unjustly tried are free 
And people live in peace I say 
Give the man release 
Go on and set your conscience free 
Right the wrongs you made 
Even a fool can have his day 


Let us all be free free free free 
Let us all be free free free free 
Let us all be free free free free 


Free our bodies free our minds 
Free our hearts 
Freedom for everyone 
And freedom now

There're no words to say 
No words to convey 
This feeling inside I have for you 

Deep in my heart
Save from the guards 
Of intellect and reason
Leaving me at a loss 
For words to express my feelings

Deep in my heart 
Look at me losing control 
Thinking I had a hold
But with feelings this strong 
I'm no longer the master 
Of my emotions"

Two weeks in a Virginia jail 
For my lover for my lover 
Twenty thousand dollar bail 
For my lover for my lover 


And everybody thinks 
That I'me the fool 
But they don't get 
Any love from you 


The things we won't do for love 
I'd climb a mountain if I had to 
And risk my life so I could have you 
You, you, you... 


Everyday I'm psychoanalyzed 
For my lover for my lover 
They dope me up and I tell them lies 
For my lover for my lover 


I follow my heart 
And leave my head to ponder 
Deep in this love 
No man can shake 
I follow my heart 
And leave my mind to wonder 
Is this love worth 
The sacrifices I make"

That may never be
But I'll keep on wishing

I'll keep on wishing 

I'll toss my coins in the fountain

Search for shooting stars in the night
Cross my fingers and dream on

Of a world
Far from present day reality
But I'll keep on dreaming 

No matter how unrealistic
Or naive
It may seem 
Always keep dreaming 

And toss your coins in the fountain
Look for clovers in grassy lawns
Search for shooting stars in the night
Cross your fingers and dream on 

We must always be thinking
Of a world
As a place of infinite possibilities
And always keep thinking 

No matter how hopeless
Or foolish
It may seem
Always keep thinking 

And toss our coins in the fountain
Look for clovers in grassy lawns
Search for shooting stars in the night

I'll keep on wishing
We must always keep dreaming
Of a world
With equality and justice
Thinking
There could be a world
Without poverty and sickness
Wishing
Of a world
Without hunger and homelessness

Where all people live in peace

All you folks think you own my life 
But you never made any sacrifice 
Demons they are on my trail 
I'm standing at the crossroads of the hell 
I look to the left I look to the right 
There're hands that grab me on every side 


All you folks think I got my price 
At which I'll sell all that is mine 
You think money rules when all else fails
Go sell your soul and keep your shell
I'm trying to protect what I keep inside
All the reasons why I live my life

I say the devil he a walking man 
He a fool he a liar conjurer and a thief 
He try to tell you what you want 
Try to tell you what you need 


Standing at the point 
The road it cross you down 
What is at your back 
Which way do you turn 
Who will come to find you first 
Your devils or your gods

You can close your eyes
And see a picture perfect life
Inside of your mind
Dreaming only of the days ahead
Wanted and wished for more than now
Or the days behind
You waste your time

The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken
The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken

You can never think
You can't even stop yourself
Before the words have been spoken
And you've already said
You would give everything
And something for nothing
Everybody thinks you're joking

The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken
The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken

You want to be the one 
Made over be your own
Before and after
And a supermarket
Beauty in a bottle queen
Who'll one day grace a check-out counter
Magazine front cover
Though the fine print reads

The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken
The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken

Lets it be broken
Lets it be broken
Lets it be broken
Lets it be broken
Lets it be broken
Broken
Broken

When your life is never what you wanted
Not even halfway normal
Just tarnished and soiled
When in your reach
A framed and frozen moment
So far from perfection
Not truth or transcendence
Will set you free
Still you don't believe

The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken
The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broke"

And racist tempers fly

I'm gonna run out in the meadow
To catch the silence when it sings

I'm gonna force the Serengeti
To disappear into my eyes
Then when I hear your voices callin'
I'm gonna turn just inside out

Well if I ever get to slumber
Just like a mole deep in the ground
Hell, I won't be found

Deep in the dust forgotten gathered
I grow a diamond in my chest
I make reflections as the moon shines on
Turn to a villain as I rest

Well if I ever get to slumber
Just like a mole deep in the ground
Hell, I won't be found

I know there is a hollow
I need to fill it with a draft
Of all the words that I wont way
And with a quiet whisper
I send a curse upon the day
That never used the sun to see
The light

I'm gonna float up in the ceiling
I built a levee of the stars
And in my field of tired horses
I built a freeway through this farce

Well if I ever get that slumber
Ill be that mole deep in the ground
And I won't be found"

Till the oceans gone
And he will pull
Till the collar breaks
And everyone
That he will run down
Will see his limbs
as they grow and bleed

But we'l see

So that they could lift me by my shoulders
Take me from this frozen lake and let you know

Never know when you're behind that angle with a tranquilizer gun in your sweet pair(?)

All That Matters
The love in you and the love in me, is all that matters
All the rest is vanity
That time will shatter
The only treasure in the life we live, is the measure of the love we give
All that matters in the end will be
The love in you and the love in me, that's all that matters

Every heart must change it's shape
To fit the space a lifetime makes
Some regrets and some mistakes
We touch happiness but we can't hold her
Feelings come and then disappear
I know the laughter, i've cried those tears
I should know better after all these years
But i'm no wiser, i'm just older


It's all a question of priority
We've got so much that we just don't need
But if it ain't got love then it's luxury
We can learn to live without it"

Until it's gone
Well i guess i'll love you more

That i'll miss you when you're gone
But if this is the end
Then the damage has been done
Where did i go wrong

How could i believe that we are history, my love
Even though you give yourself to someone else.
I will give you all the time you need to work things out
When all of the excitement gone
And you're wondering where you went wrong
Please remember me.

I guess i've got to learn to give you room to breathe
When all i really want to do is love you close to me
They say that i have got to be tough
That god will see me through
And though i know you love me
I'm confused, 'cos he wants me to be with you
I have never felt so very much alone
But if this is the end oh then i guess i'll carry on
No matter what you've done.

How could i believe that we are history, my love

Amazing Grace
Amazing grace! how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now i see.

'twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour i first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will be my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing god's praise
Than when we'd first begun."
125,Folk,Cliff Richard,Miscellaneous ,A Misunderstood Man ,"The story is a famous one
Now worshiped, now dismissed
Rehearsed and trawled for meanings
That may well not exist
The demon at the story's heart

The cuckoo in the nest
Gives little of himself away
Which is of course why you will stay
In case he falters, should betray
By whom or what possessed

These are the facts of the matter
These are the names in the case
This is the story, the passion
The time and the place

They're laid here before you
So judge if you can
The devil incarnate or
A misunderstood man

His origins, his way of life
His motives they're all news
No shortage of detractors
To air their noisy views

The man inspires a thousand lies
The lover takes his choice
Remaining coldly in control
Aware that sadly, on the whole
It is the fool who bares his soul
I'll give the man a voice

These are the facts of the matter
These are the names in the case
This is the story, the passion
The time and the place

They're laid here before you
So judge if you can
The devil incarnate or
A misunderstood man"

Be true to her memory, she'll come back one day
And though there was no one, nobody to see
A voice in the wilderness brought comfort to me

We had a quarrel, I was unkind
Why did you leave me? Love made me blind
My darlin', forgive me, I yearn for your touch
Have pity, come back now, I need you so much

Of a woman who stole both his life and soul

Be with me always in flesh or as a ghost

Who is my protector? When comes my help?
Who is there to calm me but she
God shall be my witness that I pray she will know
Not one moment of rest in the cold, cold ground

Be with me always consume and invade me
Take any shape or disguise
Be with me always to share all my despair
And to learn nothing justifies, reckless, inhuman lies

Here comes the night, the abyss unrelenting
Casting all reason aside
And I see in myself all the things I see in you
Hear the savage I am crying

Be with me always possess me and haunt me
Take any form or take none
Be with me always in flesh or as a ghost
And you'll learn as the ages run, learn what your sin has done

Take any shape or disguise
Just be with me always to share all my despair

144,Folk,Cliff Richard,Miscellaneous ,Christmas Never Comes ,"Talk about the heart of Christmas
Talk about the reason and the rhyme
Talk about the sentimental feelings
Talk about the candlelight and wine
Talk about the children

Listen to the voices singing
Listen to the laughter as they play
But listen to the whisper of a heartbeat
Whose loneliness is never far away

In some hearts it's never Christmas
But it's winter all the time
All our lives spent waiting for the sun
Children of tomorrow

How they need a star to follow
In some hearts it's always winter
For some hearts it seems
That Christmas never comes

Don't forget the winter's children
Shadows on a star that never shines
Looking for the love that never happened
Looking for the Chris in Christmas time
The lonely voice that can't rejoice, that has no choice

In some hearts it's never Christmas
But it's winter all the time
All our lives spent waiting for the sun
Children of tomorrow

How they need a star to follow
In some hearts it's always winter
For some hearts it seems
That Christmas never comes

In some hearts it's never Christmas
But it's winter all the time

With no one left to beat
There's still a fading desire
To burn a naked light
Just to defy the night
Come on and call me a liar

A crumble tumble down
In fumble bumble town
Our lives a ruin
We reconstruct a bit
And pretty up a bit
We hardly know what we're doing

But me and my baby
Make the best of this world
She's like a diamond, innocent girl
We watch the sign of the times
Writing on the wall cities may fall

Back through the city fog
I was another cog
For the machinery there
Now the machines have gone
The silence hanging on
I sit, I stare

But me and my baby
Make the best of this world
She's like a diamond, innocent girl
We watch the sign of the times
Writing on the wall cities may fall

Come on and take your aim
I feel the mildest pain
Protecting something so rare
'Cos there's a gem or two
Inside the human zoo
If only you are aware

But me and my baby
Make the best of this world
She's like a diamond, innocent girl
We watch the sign of the times
Writing on the wall cities may fall"

What's to become of me, should feelings be denied?
Another time, another place, would I be the same old face
For you to have around?

There's no way in, there's no way out, I'm caught in the middle
Why must you leave my heart in doubt?
We have a one-way love that flows from me to you
There's nothing more for me to lose

We're through with talking now, we know that it's the end
We've played our foolish games and it's useless to pretend
It seems like only yesterday that love had come to stay
How could we be so blind?

Why must you leave my heart in doubt?

Since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came into you sweet lady
Answering your mystical call

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned

I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I'd come there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind
Stay away, look out

If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighborhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast

Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

Dream Tomorrow
I shall think it a dream tomorrow
I won't believe you returned
That once again i saw and touched you
And you're so unconserned, unconcerned

You must have known that your cruel silence
Would be so hard to bear
And yet you let me wait, you let me wait and
Wonder
Neither here nor there, here nor there

I came back with just one intention
For one last look, one last taste of you
Revenge on those who still despise me
And take my own life too

But there's a long and twisted journey
Between this callous thought and deed
And you're a sweeter way to give me
All the things i need

Two ambitions coincidind
Will only happen now and then
Never hope or dream tomorrow
Will restore your faith again
Never hope or dream tomorrow
Will restore your faith again

How i hope it's no dream tomorrow
But i'm scared the light will fade
And today will be a vague recollection
Just a fool's escapade, escapade

I never cared much about the future
Yesterday was always there
So when you give me hope, hope or a promise
It just isn't fair, isn't fair

Any plan, any calculation
Any plot or device at all
Runs into another's dream
Runs into a wall

No matter what premeditation
In our three score years and ten
There are only fractured moments
We'd want to live again

Two ambitions coinciding
Will only happen now and then
Never hope or dream tomorrow
Will restore your faith again
Never hope or dream tomorrow
Will restore you faith again"

Your secrets are all known
Never cross the great divide
Each to his own

Don't misunderstand me, don't be hurt, don't take offence
But what i am about to tell you makes a lot of sense
I've been more than happy with you, loved you as you are
But being happy only takes a restless heart so far

Be thankful for the past but know those times won't come again
I found you quite diverting, even tender now and then
Remember i will always be the first to sing your praise
But i must close the book on our adolescent days

Nothing can be permanent
Nothing set in stone
Never try to fool yourself
That you are not alone
Know your place don't chance your arm

That we'd decay together in some endless heart to heart

We will rise and set men free
We will applaud your majesty
We will proclaim your kingdom come
We will announce the battle done
We will lift up the righteous one

Look me up if you're in my town
You made a friend, be sure of that

Let me know if you're free, come down
You're making plans, things you'll do
Said I'll be someone I'm telling you

I'm gonna leave this town
Play me some rock 'n roll
I'm gonna find myself
I'm gonna free my soul

We took a walk out in the gray
You didn't speak but had much to say
Don't talk too loud walls have ears

Criticize and you'll disappear
A souvenir from where you've gone
A pair of jeans or some chewing gum

I'm gonna leave this town
Play me some rock 'n roll
I'm gonna find myself
I'm gonna free my soul

They had something to hide
To keep me out or
Is it to keep you inside?

I'm gonna free me"

From A Distance
From a distance, the world looks blue and green,
And the snow capped mountains so white.
From a distance the ocean meets the stream,
And the eagle takes to flight.
From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land.
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace,
It's the voice of every man.

From a distance, we all have enough,
And no-one is in need.
There are no guns, no bombs and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed.
For a moment we must be instruments,
Martching in a common band,
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace,
They're is the songs of every one.

God is watching us, god is watching us,
God is watching us, from a distance.

From a distance, you look like my friend,
Even though we are at war.
From a distance, i can't comprehend,
What all this war is for.
What we need is love and harmony,
Let it echo through the land.
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,
It's the heart of everyone.
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,
It's the song of everyone.

Sing out, songs of hope,
Sing out, songs of freedom,
Sing out, songs of love,
Sing out, songs of peace,
Sing out, songs of justice,
Sing out, songs of harmony,
Sing out, songs of love,
Sing out, everyone,
Sing out, songs of hope,
Sing out, songs of freedom,
Sing out, songs of love,
Sing out, songs of peace,
Sing out, songs of justice,
Sing out, songs in harmony,
Sing out, sing about love,
Sing out, everyone.

God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen
God rest ye, merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay,
Remember christ our savior was  born on christmas day;
To save us all from satan's power when we were gone astray.

O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy

From god our heav'nly father a blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same;
How that in bethlehem was born the son of god by name.

""fear not, then,"" said the angel, ""let nothing you afright
This day is born a savior of a pure virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in him from satan's power and might.&quot;

The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind,
And went to bethl'em straightaway this blessed babe to find.

But when to bethlehem they came whereat this infant lay,
They found him in a manger where oxen feed on hay;
His mother mary kneeling unto the lord did pray.

Now to the lord sing praises all you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace;
This holy tide of christmas all others doth deface.

God bless the ruler of this house, and send him long to reign,
And many a merry christmas may live to see again;
Among your friends and kindred that live both far and near--
That god send you a happy new year, happy new year,
And god send you a happy new year."

In Liverpool, in squalor cast adrift
A dirty ragged mess of desperation
Though devil touched, I took as God's gift

No history, no owner, no rhyme, no reason
Nor explanation of his sorry state
And all the fire of the survivor
I couldn't leave it, I couldn't leave it to it's fate

What are we to do with it?
Dirty, ragged, coloured breed
Welcome it with open arms
Welcome one more mouth to feed

Could your own blood not provide you
With the gratitude you need?
We will call the boy, Heathcliff

And every man on earth conceals a secret
On which he feeds and yet tears him apart
And in this child so great that complication
Will surely destroy the strongest heart

And as you fall into the traps, he sets you
And as you're drawn to cross his reckless line
And as I watch you peer into his darkness
I pray you'll never search, I pray you'll never search for mine

What are we to do with it?
Dirty, ragged, coloured breed
Welcome it with open arms
Welcome one more mouth to feed

Could your own blood not provide you
With the gratitude you need
Gonna call him Heathcliff

Let her loose
In a world where the fake
And shallow shine

Or understand tonight, I'll see it all unfold before my eyes
Tonight, with fortune on my side and love to
Guide me
The future is looking bright, tonight

Believe in love
Hold on, there's nothing under heaven we can't overcome
So hold on
And tho' the road ahead maybe unknown, we'll make it
If we hold on"

Hold Us Together
Nothing ever stays the same
Everything must change
Just take a look around you
You know it will astound you

History unfolding shows us
Good intentions pass
And a love once pledged in moonlight
Isn't guaranteed to last

Chorus:
(only your love is constant baby)
(only my love for you)
Only your love can hold us together
Only you - and everything you do
Just one kiss and my dreams come true
Only you - and everything you say
Only loving you - can make me feel this way
People who just play at love
Make loving something cheap
And it's only worth the playing if we
Play the game for keeps

The book of life has pages girl
That you and i must turn
And in every chapter in every story
Something there to learn

Repeat chorus

Love is patient, love is kind
Love is rarely ever blind
Take a look and you will find

That love is just caring
And sharing our loving together"

My search is over
I've got all of the riches that money don't buy

And your face is more than perfection
The way I watch you move it only goes to prove
In everything to do

Very few find peace and succour
In the spouse or life that they choose

Understand him
That he loves me is my belief

We'd be in some lovers' heaven
Our way ahead and dreams so clear
I welcome you into my family
Into it's dark internal wars
Let me enter into battle
I have the will i have the cause

No-one leaves him
But they're damaged
And stripped of every vestige of good

Is he man or
Is he devil?
I see but dread the likelihood

I shall not stay poor isabella
So never heed my marriage vow
Believe in time you won't regret this
Thought it may disturb you now
Abandon all attempts to love me
Don't fool yourself that's what you feel
When you at last decide to hate me
At least your emotion will be real

Wolfish, savage
Tuned to madness
Love is stifled, joy denied

I do hate him

A cold contaminated bride

Is the world you knew

Is not so sweet
I can't imagine why you'd throw it all away
After everything i've said to you today
When you turn around to find there's
No one then you finally realize what you've done

In the night when there's no one there at all
In the night do you hear somebody call
You see someone and you tell yourself you're wrong
You hear a voice and you know it must belong
To the night just a shadow on the wall
And there's no one there at all

I gave you everything
Everything i had endlessly
Believing your love was true
And you will never know just how it hurt
To find that you were turning to someone new
I know that we can't ever change
What has been said but how can i
Believe our love is really dead
When you turn around to find there's no one
Then you finally realize what you've done

While you keep shining through
I still believe in you

If you take a chance, you'll see

But one by one those fantasies have failed
While you keep shining through

I am not afraid when I can hold you tight
If there must be an answer then there must be a prayer
And you must be the angel when you're standing there
So I lean on you, I lean on you

My life is such a statement of my hopes and despairs
But nothing really matters just as long as you're there
You love me such honesty, you love with no gain
You speak to me so tender and you never explain
So I lean on you, I lean on you

My baby she cares, it's so easy to do
My baby she tells me what to do
She always tells me the truth
My baby she cares, it's so easy to do
My baby knows what I'm gonna do
That's why I lean on you

I dream of an island, of a fantasy place
Where I can go to sometimes and nobody can trace
Well such is the nature, the nature of love
That when we dream it sometimes means that we need love
So I lean on you, I lean on you

My baby she cares, it's so easy to do
My baby she tells me what to do
She always tells me the truth
My baby she cares, it's so easy to do
My baby knows what I'm gonna do
That's why I lean on you

So I lean on you, I lean on you
I lean on you, so I lean on you

My baby she cares, it's so easy to do
My baby she tells me what to do
She always tells me the truth
My baby she cares, it's so easy to do

Learning How To Rock'n'roll
Billy on his way to school
Didn't care too much about the teachers and rules
But he had a plan he said he'd try it one day
One he knew would leave them all with nothing to say
He had a friend who said he'd teach him how to rock and roll
After school when he was feelin' good
He'd go home and do the things that he understood
He would rock in the kitchen and roll in the hall
And billy's mother said you got no sense at all
But we know too well that he was
Learning how to rock and roll

'cos he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more
And that's the only way to do it
When you're learning how to rock and roll
Teach me to rock...

Willy turns to the mirror and gives his hair a flip
He would mime to elvis and curl his lip
Ha ha in the kitchen
Ha ha in the hall
Willy's mother said you got no sense at all
But we know too well that he was
Learning how to rock and roll

'cos he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more
And that's the only way to do it
When you're learning how to rock and roll
Teach me to rock...

He learnt to rock and roll
And sing the blues
He learnt to head shake
While singing blue suede shoes
He learnt a hand clap
Off the beat
And at the gig he had them out of their seats
It's the only way to do it so long live rock and roll

'cos he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more
And that's the only way to do it
When you're learning how to rock and roll
Teach me to rock..."

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by

Yet in the dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven

We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
The Lord Emmanuel

No ear may hear his coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in

Lost In A Lonely World
Tomorrow never comes when you are looking foward to it
You try so hard to live the day your way
But what a life if you could live the way you want it
You tried it once before but it didn't work out
You know you need someone to bring out the best in you

To be a light to you is what i intend to do
To show the way you know you ought to go
You'll see a world that will surely come into view
So take the hand that i offer to you
To see the truth that you will be no longer

Lost, lost in a lonely world (lost and lonely)
'cos i can see that there's life in your eyes
If only you would realise
That now you don't have to settle for this

You don't have to say ""there's nowhere to go""
You can find out anything you really wanna know"

Hot blood is rushing through my heart and soul

Love is the strongest emotion
No-one can stop what we do
Love is the strongest emotion
That you'll ever feel when your love is real

I've been awake all night, my eyes are open wide
I never dreamed you, you're no fantasy
Oh, don't make me wait too long
'Cause you're the only one girl you change my
Wishes to reality

Love is the strongest emotion
No-one can stop what we do
Love is the strongest emotion
That you'll ever feel when your love is real

And I wanna touch, and I wanna feel what you do to me
'Cause nothing on earth can move me like you
Come on baby show me 'cause I need to give my
Love to you

I wanna touch, and I wanna feel what you do to me
'Cause, nothing on earth can move me like you
Come on baby show me, 'cause I need to
Give my love

She's found another and he says it's the end
To think they once tore down a wall for a door
But now they don't speak anymore

So he walks the streets, the few nights he can stand
Drinking her memory away when he can
Friends once would reach out to them from the shore
But now they don't cry anymore

How does it all come to happen?
That's not what loving is for
And if I thought it was, I would leave here in the morning
I'd sooner sleep on the floor

Oh, when will we learn really what loving is?
It's not what you get in return but what you give
To think they once tore down a wall for a door
But now they don't speak anymore"

A definite maybe
But luck she's a lady, stayed
She played for me

There's gold in the mountain
Good fortune for countin'
Three coins in the fountain
And my luck won't change

Take dust from the coal mine
Make dust from the goldmine
King Midas you're sidelined
And my luck won't change no my luck remains

No point in shouting
Whoever there was doubting
I'm at the top of the mountain
And my luck won't change

The stock market read it
The rumors they spread it
And I meant it when I said it
That my luck won't change
No my luck remains

That old lover lost me
She spent and she cost me
My new love has taught me
That my luck won't change
(My luck won't change, my luck remains)

The offer she made me
Was more than just maybe
But luck who's a lady stayed
She played for me

There's gold in the mountain

Take dust from the coal mine

The Phoenix is arising
And my luck won't change, no it just remains

Do i keep it to myself
Or should i let her know i'm in love

Do i nurse it in my heart
Hold it back in my eyes
Hide it all inside
Or put on a disguise i'm in love

Have i gotta play games
Even suffer the pain
Let the secret out
Even suffer the doubt i'm in love

I know it's all there
I really wanna share my life
With someone else
Will she feel the same

Or should i let her know i'm in love
It isn't so easy when you've broken before
But it isn't so hard when you're ready for more
Could you love me

Give me a simple clue
Anything will do
So long as i know
What's in me is in you
Could you love me

I've got so much of care to give away
There's only one thing i wanna hear you say
I love you...

Never Say Die
You look so sad - like you lost your only friend
Don't feel so bad - you can always try again
So don't hide, go seek, don't let the grass grow
Under your feet
Get out, get up, get on, get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight

You give a little bit more
If you want her back - it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in you
Give a little bit more
When you think you're through what you gotta do is
Give a little bit more

She said goodbye
So tell yourself that's all
(that's all, she's gone)
But your hands ain't tied
Why you make yourself so small (don't think so small)
So don't hide - go seek - don't let the grass grow
Under your feet
Get out - get up - get on - get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight

Don't give up the fight - you gotta keep on
Going with all you might
Try hard don't stop - gotta keep on giving it
All you got
Never give up - never give up - never say die
Believe in, can reach the top
Gotta give it a shot don't say no gotta
Get in the flow

So don't hide go seek
Don't runaway - get back on your feet
Get out - get up - get on - get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight

No Power In Pity
I don't know how to love you.
Where do i begin.
It helplessness is sinning
Then here i am a sinner
Guilty of sin.

I don't know how to help you
Your trouble goes so deep
You're about to lose your life
And here i am dejected
'cos i love a night of sleep.

Love one another you said
Come together as one.
I'm just a servant, lord
Yet you made me a son
Sometimes i'm troubled
By the things you make me see.
But no matter how i feel, lord
Here am i send me.

So i leave the world behind me
And enter this domain.
I'm staggered by the gulf
Between us.
I can see your sickness
But i don't feel your pain.

Pity's got no power
Compassion has the heart
Jesus, keep me mindful
That it's you who does the
Giving.
And it's we who need to
Play our part."

November Night
across the wet november night
The church is bright with candlelight
And waiting evensong, (2x)
A single bell with plaintive strokes
Pleads louder than the stirring oaks
The leafless lanes along. (2x)

It calls the choirboys from their tea
And villagers, the two or three,
Damp down the kitchen fire (2x)
Let out the cat, and up the lane
Go paddling through the gentle rain
Of misty oxfordshire (2x)

On country morning sharp and clear
The penitent in faith draw near
And kneeling here below (2x)
Partake the heavenly banquet spread
Of sacramental wine and bread
And jesus' presence know (2x)

And must that plaintive bell in vain
Plead loud along the dripping lane?
And must the building fall? (2x)
Not while we love the church and live
And of our charity will give
Our much, our more, our all (2x)"

And a freedom burning bright

Of the yellow, black and white

When there is lightening in the sky
When the rivers are rising
And trouble rolls in on the tide

We'll keep on keeping on
'Til all the tears are dry
We'll weather the storm and welcome the dawn
Of tomorrow you and I

Les nuits se changeaient en matin
Dans la fumee des cigarettes
Une guitare a la main
Il ne manquait pas un accord
A cette chanson qui disait au refrain
Remember.remember

On aurait du rester comme ca
Poete et musicien
Puisqu'on ne savait faire que ca
L'amour change i'amour oublie
L'un de nous sous la pluie
A mesure que le temps s'en va
Quels sont les mots qui nous ont trahis quand meme
Pour dire je t'aime
Qui s'en souvient quand ce n'etait plus toi

Maybe you feel this world is to blame
You've been cryin'

Only, only inside will you know
But still you wonder sometimes
Where can, where can you go?

Remember me, oh, when you feel this way
And you need someone to lean on

Ever too far away

I am the one, I am the one

Remember me, I am the one

Remember me, I am your guardian angel
And I'll never let you fall

And if you're ever
Ever in fear or danger

I am the one, I am the one who will turn
(Remember me)

Remember me, I am the one

Turn all your darkness
To light in the morning
You learn when you're too hard on yourself
You can call me

You picked me up when I was living down in Egypt
Led me out and opened up the door
When you showed me just how much you thought my heart meant
But I turned and walked away into the wilderness
Now who would have guessed

I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I thought I'd wandered too far away
But now I've got a brand new start
Reunion, reunion of the heart

Now I'm standing on the edge of the land
I want to go out and take all that you gave me
But I'm frightened and you understand
I failed you last time and I don't want a repeat
Still when I'm quiet again I shelter from the noise
I just hear your voice

I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I thought I'd wandered too far away
But now I've got a brand new start

Not one ribbon for her hair

Through the night my heart was aching
Just before the dawn was breaking
I peeked in and on her bed, in gay profusion lying there
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons

But never told the boy her heart was breaking

That secretly his love was growing
And now he's coming back to stay

Help them grow a little stronger

Such Is A Mystery
Let the day fall all around you
And let the breath of life surround you
What a day it should be a holiday
And these lazy days are hard to come by
Here for our pleasure,a moment to treasure
Stay with me and lend me your company

For you,you show to me
All the world gives for free
And there's no more that a man can ever ask for
And if we,we could see half he gave us to see
Then we'd be half way to finding the answer

So where will all the seasons go
It's for us to ask,it's for him to know
It's too much for me,for such is the mystery
And all these things we take for granted
But how did they get here,when were they planted?
If we could see,then what would the answer be?

For you,you show to me
All the world gives for free
And there's no more that a man can ever ask for
And if we,we could be half he wants us to be
Then we'd be half way to finding the answer

Today we'll see butterfly
And we'll smell the grass and we'll feel the sky
Oh what a day,let no one take this away
But i will live my life forever,asking the questions
But answers will never come to me
For such is the mystery

For you,you show to me
All the world gives for free
And there's no more that a man can ever ask for
And if we,we could be half he wants us to be
Then we'd be half way to finding the answer"

And how you changed the taste of love for me

You were my one more chance

You were the one moment

No one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you

And we'll have no ending
If we can hold on
And I think I've come this far because of you
Could be no other love but yours will do

Jack frost nipping at your nose.
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir,
And folks dressed like eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some misletoe,
Help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow,
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that santa's on his way,
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh,
And every mother's child is gonna spy,
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so, i'm offering this simple phrase,
To kids from one to ninety two.
Altho's it's been said many times many ways,
Merry christmas to you.

The Gambling Song
The wheels forever spinning
The dice are thrown and scatter
The words are all of winning
But only numbers matter

We bet on our existence
We'll last another round
The lucky go the distance
The losers go to ground

From birth to death we gamble
The lots are daily cast
No warning or preamble
Which one will be your last

There is a great comfort in pure hatred
For envy's not enough, not enough
The soothing joy of malice
Is made of sterner stuff, sterner stuff
The failure of a father
The torment of a son
Is a recipe to justify
The worst that could be done

He'll destroy us unless we call a halt
Should the bastard steal our birthright
It will be our fault

The race is won by cunning
A terrifying dance
Too complex in the running
To leave it all to chance

But chance is all we're given
So chances we must take
The gambler's stake is driven
Through hearts that dare not break

But all save one are broken
As fatal points are scored
And one surviving token
Holds sway across the board

There's a moment when the game's balance
Tilts the other way, the other way
When the odds begin to favour
Outsiders in the play, in the play
The failure of incumbents
The sleazy tricks they use
Mean that those who think they call
The tune can only lose

Deal the cards, it won't matter how they fall
Because nothing is a gamble when you want it all"

The Golden Days Are Over
She locks the bedroom door - lies face down on the bed
Hears voices down the hall - are they real or in her head
Pictures on the wall - reminders every one
Just memories of the past - of a time that's
Been and gone
All those wild and crazy nights - they still
Dance before her eyes
(those crazy nights - her name in lights)

Look at her now the golden days are over
Look at her now no leading man to hold her
She was one in a million now she's that
Forgotten face
Look at her now the golden days are over

Applauded by the press - an overnight success
A favourite with the fans - had them eating
From her hands
But stars fall from the sky - in the twinkle
Of an eye
There's no more silver screen just another
Broken dream
Still she strikes a classic pose - just in case
The cameras roll
(she steals the scene - relieves the dream)

Look at her now the golden days are over
Look at her now no leading man to hold her
She was one in a million now she's that
Forgotten face
Look at her now she needs someone to hold her
To feed her lines - someone to co-star
Someone to shine

Look at her now the golden days are over
(the golden days are over - they're over)
Look at her now no leading man to hold her
(no m.g.m. - no paramount - no 20th century)
Look at her now the golden days are over

And i am lord of wuthering heights
Burn in hell, you filthy gypsy

Would never pay me dividends

Catherine wanted only me

I was constant, i was tender

And you could never comprehend
My cold and angry isolation

When two hearts drift away
You can hear the voices say

Didn't ever really mean a thing

There's no room for anyone

Taken so soon but love burns so true
Love never ending that shines like the stars in the sky

Time has no distance deep in love

Cry if you must
But love is the answer
Bringing two worlds together

Who can see the secrets that bind us?
Back to the earth 'til love rings so true
Eyes of compassion and tears of a deepening heart

I have seen the pain of a cruel world
And reached out a hand for suffering to ease
Bringing some comfort to the tears

Dying to survive
Shaken by the irony the anger rose inside of me
And would not, would not subside
I thought you're too young to understand
That the fate of every mortal man
Rests in someone's mortal hand tonight
In the nuclear insanity there's a death watch
On the land and sea
And i believe that we may never live our lives

We were born under the gun and just like
Every mother's son
We are hostage to the megaton and the world
Could die tonight
Under the gun, we live in fear that the end
Will come
But there's one place to run
Run to the son

Everyone can see that the hour is late
And every soul on earth got to demonstrate
Their loving if we're to survive
'cos we're tired of living on the brink
Scared to death that our ship will sink
At the winking of an eye
This course we're on's a big mistake

'cos we all lose in the nuclear race
It's time to show all the heads of state that we
Believe
Yes we believe that we're fighting for our lives
We were born under the gun and just like

We could be here wild in our wishes
With all the love that's in my heart

So you could ride away
To the one you love
And be here for this day

When Two Worlds Drift Apart
We turned water into wine but that didn't last
We were the victims of our age
Now we live on different floors
And go our separate ways
And talk behind closed doors
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart

We used to sit around the fire
And whisper words the world outside would make no claim to hear
But now we talk an octave higher
In droning tones that don't relate at all to yester year
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart

Do you remember when we were seventeen
We took a boat out for an hour
But we preferred the greenery to the scenery of the sea
And tied up in some cosy cove
Till harbour lights appeared across the bay

Into love and out of mind
A poet claimed that loving you has only made me blind
But love is really crystal clear
It's only when you need someone the clouds will soon appear
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart

Do you remember when laughter was the cure
For all the hard times that we knew
But we forgot to feed the fire - let it all burn down
Warmth returns to cold and poison into pain
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart"

From the bleak and familiar
To the tropical strange
Through the glamour of empires abroad
I never abandoned
The hope of reclaiming
My legitimate reward

You never would have known
The mountains i'd climb

I won't be without again, woman
You won't drive me out again, woman
And as you come to learn
All that *i've done was for you
You'll see what obsession can do
Woman

So the unschooled outcast
The irascible youth
Has become all the things you desired
I took all they offered
And learned their deceptions
All relentlessly acquired

And the eyes of the traveller
See an obvious truth
You've become all the things you've denied
And the loss of ambition
Was colouring your reason
As the pleasure in you died

When you thought of me
Had me on your mind
You never would have dreamed
Of the riches i'd find

Don't care what the story's worth
All i care is that you're here beside me
My angel - here on earth.

Loving heart and healing hands

And you've got that feeling now you know it too well

Say okay to your dreams
Never let that chance go by again
If it's love you need then listen and listen well

You've got to run like a young love
You've got to love like young love
Believe me, you'll be a young love
You don't need to be anymore

Well, you can think like a young love
Be strong like a young love
Then you can run like a young love
You don't need to be anymore

Live it now everyday
'Cos you know there is no better way
And in time you'll understand
It's all in your heart

Lightning strikes in the rain
But you know inside you're strong again
You can hear the thunder roll
But you stand apart

You know you do when you can run like a young love
You've got to love like young love
Believe me, you'll be a young love
You don't need to be anymore

As long as you think like a young love
Be strong like a young love
Then you can run like a young love
You don't need to be anymore

Run like a young love

Think like a young love
You know how you feel

You can be strong
Run like a young love

A million different questions fail to get an answer

Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. 
You know I'm only human. 
You know I make mistakes, 
But I do believe there's a spiritual side to my life. 
As we begin this new Millennium, 
I'd like to be more helpful than hurtful, 
More grateful than grumbling. 
I would like to build people up, not fear them down. 
I would like to know you better 
And to live my life more the way 
You have in mind for me. 
I may not be there yet, 
So I'm asking you for help. 
And by saying this prayer 
I'm taking one step closer."

Let me be your shelter, let me be your light

All I want is freedom, a world with no more night
And you always beside me, to hold me and to hide me

Let me lead you from your solitude

Anywhere you go, let me go too, that's all I ask of you

As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes
And I thank God for all the joy in my life, oh, but most of all

For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
""Walk beside the pony daddy, it's my first ride
I know the cake looks funny, daddy, but I sure tried""
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning and butterfly kisses at night

Sweet sixteen today
And she's looking like her momma, a little more every day
One part woman, the other part girl
Into perfume and makeup, from ribbons and curls
Trying her wings out in a great big world but I remember

Those butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
""You know how much I love you, daddy, but if you don't mind
I'm only gonna kiss you on cheek this time""
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night

All this precise time
Like the wind, the years go by
Precious butterfly
Spread your wings and fly

She'll change her name today
She'll make a promise and I'll give her away
Standing in the bride room just staring at her
She asks me what I'm thinking and I said, ""I'm not sure
I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl"" and she leaned over and gave me

Butterfly kisses, with her mama there
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
""Walk me down the aisle daddy, it's just about time
Does my wedding gown look pretty, daddy? Daddy, don't cry""
With all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve her love every morning, butterfly kisses

The dragon draws the iron curtain round against the Light
And souls grow weary in this war of Love
And seek their solace strolling down sweet civilian ways
But meanwhile back at the world's dark end

Where is the resistance, will no-one be strong

Battalions of darkness rise above me
But God put a fighter in me, put a fighter in me
We will sing songs of victory
We will arise and set men free
We will applaud Your Majesty
We will proclaim Your Kingdom come
We will announce the battle done
We will lift up the Righteous One

And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same;

To free all those who trust in Him from Satan's power and might.""

And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind,
And went to Bethlehem straightaway this blessed Babe to find.


O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy 

But when to Bethlehem they came whereat this Infant lay,
They found Him in a manger where oxen feed on hay.
His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray.

And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace;

And many a merry Christmas may live to see again;

What makes us give our all?
And why do we aspire,
To reach the height,
When we're not ready,
To take the fall? 

What makes us so unkind?
And why must we desire?
And take what we want?
Why must we be the,
Only ones who receive?

Take me and break me.
Burn me with your fire.
Our love that will take me.
Take me and make me.

I will follow you. 

Why is it that now I'm yours,
Everything seems so bright?
And why is it now I can,
Live for each day,
Without any fear of the night?

I can't get you,
Out of my head.
My life was so lonely,
Cos I was only,
Living for myself.

Larger Design

A thin blanket of sun is creeping over the lawn.
I can't seem to take my eyes off this nature so refined.
And when I've lost my way, I know there's a larger design. 

And where do I fit in?
And what part was I meant to play?
The picture is no longer gray,
When I look down into my little son's face. 

Life is a river of time, always seems to pass us by.
But I won't let it forget me without a roller coaster ride.
When I can't find the answers to the questions in between.
I take a good look around, I believe in what I've seen.

Love Never Gives Up

I know things now everyone should know
I have seen love struggle with pain
I have seen life living in vain
I saw a child - though hardly it seems
Life's not the same when you live in bad dreams

I walked around, the sun burned my head
Just a few hours, but time flowed like lead
I heard the sound of a big city cry
trying to walk while the world rushed on by
And I have seen love shining from eyes
Tearfilled but strong, gentle but wise


I have heard it told that there's no God, no God of loving
Then how come I've seen a twisted child mildly receive His loving?
Love never gives up, love keeps on flowing - on and on
Now if there's no God, then who do we blame?
'Cos though you take away God the hell still remains
And I have seen love, dampened by rain
Rise in the sun and triumph again"

Are also on the faces of people goin' by.

And let the breath of life surround you
What a day it should be a holiday

And these lazy days are hard to come by
Here for our pleasure, a moment to treasure
Stay with me and lend me your company

For you, you show to me all the world gives for free
And there's no more that a man can ever ask for
And if we, we could see half he gave us to see
Then we'd be half way to finding the answer

So where will all the seasons go
It's for us to ask, it's for him to know
It's too much for me, for such is the mystery

And all these things we take for granted
But how did they get here, when were they planted?
If we could see, then what would the answer be?

For you, you show to me all the world gives for free
And there's no more that a man can ever ask for
And if we, we could be half he wants us to be
Then we'd be half way to finding the answer

Today we'll see butterfly
And we'll smell the grass and we'll feel the sky
Oh what a day, let no one take this away

But I will live my life forever, asking the questions
But answers will never come to me
For such is the mystery

For you, you show to me all the world gives for free
And there's no more that a man can ever ask for
And if we, we could be half he wants us to be
Then we'd be half way to finding the answer"

That's What Love Is For
                Sometimes we make it harder than it is
We'll take a perfect night
And fill it up with words we don't mean
Dark sides best unseen
And we wonder why we're feeling this way 

Sometimes I wonder if we really feel the same
Why we can be unkind
Questioning the strongest of hearts
That's when we must start
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far 

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for 

Sometimes I see you
And you don't know I am there
And I'm washed away by emotions
I hold deep down inside
Getting stronger with time
It's living through the fire
And holding on we find 

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for

Or alone inside the crowd
I'm a million miles from where I want to be
And oh, day runs into night
And this room has run out of light

And though the world may spin
Here inside my heart I'm only half alive
Till I'm home again

You're the star on my horizon
Keep the fire warm for me

But long is the hate.
For peace on the earth,
How long must we wait?
Think of the colours,
The seasons, the sun.
Put an end to the sorrows,

Keep out darkness and let in light.

Right Here Waiting



Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I though would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you"

I hear your accusations darling,
And my reply is hard to find.
Oh, I wanna know you better.
Won't you consider one more time. 
River flow to shining sea,
Mountain nectar blue.
Children flow like waterfalls,
Sweeter love renew.
Peace then war, then peace again.
Trial and error true.
Oh, if you were to visit there,
You would love her too… ooooo! 

She's so beautiful.
She's so kind and free.
She's so beautiful.
She's all there is to me.
(repeat) 

Tiny planet spins through space,
Gives my life to me.
Fifteen billion human beings,
Where's our destiny?
Peace then war, then peace again.
Trial and error true.
Oh, if you were to come down there,
You would love her too… like I do!

Oh, the troubles of the day
Come rushing into my mind

And this ache that's in my heart
Gets stronger as time goes by

Morning brings relief from misery
I even manage a smile for friends I see
Darkness falls and then the shades of night
Reach out for me and try to hold me tight

And drag me down, down, down

And then once more
The night and you enfold me
And I'm caught in the web
That you spun when we first fell in love

I can't forget
The way you used to hold me
Will this memory of our love
Keep haunting me until the day I die

Darkness falls and then the shades of night
Reach out for me and try to hold me tight

Swim my way in a flood of tears

And a-yearnin' the whole night long
Pretty baby, since you went away
I haven't spent a happy day

I wake up cryin' after sobbin' and sighin'
And a-wonderin' just what went wrong
Pretty baby, I was good to you
Why'd you go and make me blue?

I need your arms to hold me tight
I need your sweet lips to kiss me goodnight
I'm so unhappy on my own
Don't don't leave me sad and lonely

I wake up cryin' after tossin' and turnin'
And a-yearnin' the whole night long

Save me from this misery

Oh baby, won'tcha save me from this misery?
Please baby, won'tcha save me from this misery?"

You gotta heartbreak
But it's not the page, page news

Six lonely days you wonder when you'll wake
From these dreams of the past, well, there's no time like the present
You think right now, there can be no one else
You say first love is best, well, we all must learn to grow

You gotta heartbreak

You gotta heartbreak
But it's not the page, page news, no, no

Don't rush love, you must take your time
Try to play it cool, got to read between the lines
If you don't she will fly away
To some far off place where she won't receive your telephone calls

Got no strength to wipe away the tears from my eyes

Only know she's gone

The sun don't shine anymore
And I don't feel fine anymore
She ain't mine anymore
No, I don't feel fine anymore
I ain't got time anymore

Seems to be such sadness in each place I go
The people laugh and still I just wouldn't know
Never stop to see who's there
Once I used to care

But the sun don't shine anymore
I don't feel fine anymore
She ain't mine anymore
No, I don't feel fine anymore
I ain't got time anymore

I can't get used to being left on my own
It takes up all the time just trying to be alone
Used to take an interest in the state of affairs
Now I only know how much I'm missing that girl
Hope the world will understand I can't lend a hand

'Cause she ain't mine anymore
I don't feel fine anymore
She ain't mine anymore

395,Folk,Cliff Richard,Miscellaneous ,More To Life ,"Free to turn like the wind on a summer day
Heart worn, like a ring around the moon
And your eyes are ablaze, reflections of time passing by
That remind you there's much more to life than standing still

Or running from place to place in the heat of the day
Just follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life

There beyond the horizon, there's another day
Far above the pain and fear you feel
The power and the peace, the greatest sensation of all
There is much more to life than you'll ever know, the rise and fall

There'll always be you and me, we're moving as one
So follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life

We all have our dreams, we all have our visions
But time after time, we're faced with decisions
Which road to follow? How hard to fight?
Then you wake up and see that there's much more to life

Free in acres of sky on a summer day
Fire that burns with hope inside your heart
We are never apart, reflections of time passing by
That remind you there's much more to life

So just follow your heart and you'll see
If you follow your heart you'll be free
'Cause there's more to life, more to life"

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Altho's it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Or where the fates will lead me?

We had a move that move was great
We could walk and stroll and Susie Q
We could do that crazy hand jive too

Remember a cat called way out Willie
A cool cat called rockin' Billy
Mama said to Willie, ""You'll ruin my home""

And you and that hand jive have got to go
'Cause he was hand, jivin' he was hand jivin'
He would hand jive day and night hand jive

Willie had a girl called jivin' Jilly
Inhibitions she didn't have any
Willie would stop, Jilly kept cryin'

To let him do that hand jive one more time
They were hand jivin', they were hand jivin'
They would hand jive day and night
Hand jive day and night

Willie and Jilly got married one fall
They had a little Willie junior and that's not all
Little Willie got famous and it's plain to see
That he did that hand jive on TV

They were hand jivin', they were hand jivin'
They would hand jive day and night hand jive
Always hand jivin', yeah, hand jivin'
We would hand jive day and night hand jive

I can remember about fifty four
Rock 'n' roll was at my door
Fifty five and Elvis was king
Rock 'n' roll was everything

Fifty six, fifty seven
Rock 'n' roll carried me to heaven
And looking in on fifty eight
They opened up that pearly gate

We could rock we could roll
Everyone could do the stroll
Dancin' just to stay alive
We all did the crazy hand jive"

We can change our minds
No harm done, we can play it safe
Not let our feelings go

But if we fall into this ocean
And it carries us away
You should know

I will not be a mistake
Or something you have to forget

I can be the slightest breeze
That passes through your life
The smile that comes from thinking
Of this rainy night

I'll be a chance you had to take
A heart you had to break
But I will not be a mistake

I can tell you now
I hope we never say goodbye
But sometimes hearts collide
And then move on

You can say that we were foolish
It was reckless, it was weak
But it won't, won't be wrong
No, no

I will not be a mistake
Or something you have to forget

I can be the slightest breeze
That passes through your life
And the smile that comes from thinking
Of this rainy night

I'll be a chance you had to take
A heart you had to break
But I will not be a mistake

Let me love you with all I have
And if we let go, then all I ask

Is to be the slightest breeze
That passes through your life
And the smile that comes from thinking
Of this rainy night

I'll be a chance you had to take
A heart you had to break
But I will not be a mistake, no, no

You're just moving on
I got nights to remember after you're gone"

Another 5 am motel
Another wordless conversation

Now I've been driving seven days

But I still can't get away

I left her there
Slipped out while she was sleeping
I left her there
Like a ghost I disappeared

Oh, I didn't even know where I was going
Oh, how did she get here?

I choose my exit signs at random
I never travel one straight line
I should be so damn hard to follow
But she's waiting every time

I left her there
Slipped out while she was sleeping
I left her there
Like a ghost I disappeared

Oh, I didn't even know where I was going
How did she get here?
How did she get here?

One of these days
I'm bound to find a town
She won't turn up
Every time I turn around

I left her there
Slipped out while she was sleeping
I left her there

Oh, I didn't even know where I was going
Tell me how did she get here?
How did she get here?

How did she do it?
How did she find me?

But somehow you're still near

Are closer than they appear

There's a place without your memory

404,Folk,Cliff Richard,Miscellaneous ,Reflections ,"Last night I had a dream
Through a swirling fog
I walked along
On the edge of a stream

I heard somebody groan
I stopped, looked into a pool
And I saw the reflection of a fool
I saw the reflection of a fool

Dragging him by his throat
Were the collar and the links of a chain
On his shoulders a coat
On his feet shoes of pain

The coat was strife
The chain was pride
I saw the reflection and I cried
I saw the reflection and I cried

Tears for myself a fool
A man chained by independence
Gripped by despair so cruel
My life was a lot of nonsense

My eyes were closed
But in my mind
I saw the reflection so unkind
I saw the reflection so unkind

Sick of life, scared of death
My days just one long futility
Feeling my emptiness
I cried, ""God set me free""

I looked once more
I don't know how
But I saw the reflection changing now
I saw the reflection changing now

A man was in my place
A man with holes in his hands and side
A man I could not face
The man I had crucified

On him was my coat
My chains and my shoes
And between reflections I must choose
Between reflections, I must choose

On him was my coat
My chains and my shoes
And between reflections I must choose
Between reflections, I must choose"

First you cuddle up beside me nice and near

Then you put your two sweet lips on mine like this
And you'll learn the magic of a tender kiss
That's the next lesson in love
Mm, give me your heart

It's so easy when you know how
Oh, my darling let me show you now

Then you whisper I love you so sweetly
And I'll know you've learned it all completely

Well, I'm not like that at all

Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one's hand
They always understand

Some people cry
Some people know why

Some people, they use one another so aimlessly
Not like lovers do
Well, I'm not like that at all

Some people they long for each other
They love to talk holding the other one's hand
They always understand

Some people cry
Some people know why

With a word unspoken with a voice unheard
When a word is broken by a tender word
When a heart is moved, when a heart is thrown
The silence tells you, you're not alone

Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one
Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one

They love to walk holding the other one
Holding the other one
Holding each other"

Your savage intent

To break away meant to break me
Oh Cathy, the game you played
Oh Cathy, you've paid
I've been betrayed

I try to find the words to justify
All that you've put Lille through
What gave you the right to leave me
When you you knew I loved you

I pray you find some peace at last
The sleep of the good if only you could

Only my life remains cold
This is a winter
Will never know spring
As time and again
I try to contain

The anger and pain that you bring
Oh Cathy, my reckless one
Oh Cathy, it's done
The long night's begun

You lie so close
So calm, so motionless
I can almost believe
You're still in my arms, within me

So near, to hear I loved you
I pray, I find some peace at last
The sleep of the good
If only I could"

Got this bus, London Transport said, ""Okay""

Okay to use this bus for transport on our holiday

They're with it
(With what?)
With the plan that I have landed them today
(What plan? That's right, what plan?)
If we can do it once, they'll back us all the way

Seven days to a holiday and there's such a lot to do
Come on, fellas, it's up to you
We're in an awful stew, get us out of this spot
Are you with us or not?

Six days to a holiday and this bus must look like new
Shiny bright as a birthday gift, give it a real facelift
And it's body, the sheen of a top beauty queen

Five more days, just five more days
To fix up dozens of things
Let's spring-clean it from front to rear
(Yes, I've cleaned all the springs)

Four days to a holiday and we know before we're through
Our bus will be safer than any bank, tough as an army tank
We will check everywhere, though it's hard to get there

Three days to a holiday and those sunny skies of blue
By the time that it leaves our shed, our bus will be bright red
And we know that we will
(Paint Paree redder still voilÃ !)

Two days to a holiday, all of the inside to do
So this old London bus can pass, as a hotel first class
We'll make everything fit including
(Ah, yes, that's it)

One more day, just one more day
So we must not waste an hour
Come on, let's get the plumbing in
(Cor, blimey, what a shower)

Off we go on our holiday and it's you we have to thank
Fellas, I cannot thank you enough for helping us with our bus"

Shout it from the rooftop to the street
And if I spread the word please tell me
Who's it gonna hurt?

I'm in love with you girl
Let me talk to the world
I feel like I'm up there riding a rocket to the moon
And I'm gonna tell them where I've been

Can't keep this feelin' in, not for another minute
I can't hold it back, you know I'm trying to
I just gotta count the ways, you bless my days
Baby, I can't keep this feelin' in

Some things should be private
Just between the two of us
Trust me when I say my lips are sealed
My god it's no big secret that I'm crazy for your love

Want to put up a sign that the lady is mine
If you're superstitious I'm gonna try to hold it down
But I'm going out there on a limb

Can't keep this feelin' in, not for another minute
I can't hold it back, you know I'm trying to
I just gotta count the ways, you bless my days
Baby, I can't keep this feelin' in

I know it's better if we take it slow
That's when the hours feel like years
I've gotta tell somebody that's all I know
If I've gotta whisper, whisper in their ears

Can't keep this feelin' in, not for another minute
I can't hold it back, you know I'm trying to
I just gotta count the ways, you bless my days
Baby, I can't keep this feelin' in"

To fight for love and faith and hope
But how was I to have known
I would have to face myself, my cover blown

Yeah, I was shaken by what I saw
You know something in you breaks
When you watch your comrades fall
And even now I suppose that the battle's not yet over
And I'm just another soldier on the field of love

On the field, on the field
On the field of love
On the field

Marching blind through the dark
Somehow it fell on me to lead the charge
I was wounded, I bear the scar
Wear it like a badge of courage on my heart

So sound the bugle and beat the drums
The sky has turned blood-red at the setting of the sun
And even now Heaven knows the battle's not yet over
And I'm just another soldier on the field of love

On the field, on the field
On the field of love
On the field

On the field, on the field
On the field of love
On the field

Should I go down
On this hallow ground
Surely more of us
Are willing to try for love, willing to die

So sound the bugle and beat the drums
Yeah, I see the night is coming on at the sinking of the sun
And even now Heaven knows that the battle's never over
As long as there's a soldier on the field of love

On the field someone falls
Friend or foe still you hate the battle call
On the field shines the light
In the saying, â€½Son, don't give up the fightâ€

On the field someone falls
Friend or foe still you hate the battle call
On the field shines the light
In the saying, â€½Son, don't give up the fightâ€

And if she's got a figure made to squeeze
Oh, won't you kindly be aware

She mesmerizes every mother's son
The girl can't help it
And if she smiles and rare steaks become well done
The girl can't help it
She makes grandpa feel like twenty-one

The girl can't help it if she was born to please
And if I go to her on bended knees

That someday the answer will be
The girl can't help it if she's in love with me"

You have to admit it and live it and live it!

Yep! We all kick the bucket in the end! The end! The end! The end! The end!

Blew up my TV. It' was numbing my brain to be thinking the same as million other people all feeling afraid of the same thing.
But there's nothing to lose, 'cause we're all on a bike and we're cycling through, getting off on our injuries - but you gotta get back on it and live it and live it to love it and live and love life.

Cause we all kick the bucket in the end! The end!

And the boys kick the bucket in the end! My friend!
Yep! We all kick the bucket in the end! The end! The end! The end! The end!

This is not a sad song!
I don't bring it up to get you down,
It's a celebration for all the red cells
Going round and round in your body!

I'm gonna hide my eyes from your crimson sin
No sacrifice can make atonement again
The blood is on your hands ; you should be ashamed

You won't forget my name
You won't forget my name

So now I say goodbye and this is to you, I pledge ;
Take your final step and plummet over the edge
You listened to the snake ! I won't take any blame
Now here's my breath in your face,
I leave you up in flames

You won't forget my name
You won't forget my name

Behold ! The angel's singing sweet
For righteousness ; a cry !
He sings for you so tenderly ;
""Apple of my eye !""

Stay right where you are ;
Don't be so foolish to try any courageous moves
You won't be saving lives
I didn't do all I've done for you to put me in the shame

Now in your final hour my legacy remains

You won't forget my name
You won't forget my name

Behold ! The angel's singing sweet
For righteousness ; a cry !
I sing for you so tenderly ;

428,Folk,Charlie Winston,Hobo ,Every Step ,"I'm a fool to be kind to you
It's not what the men in your life tend to do
Must be so strange, finding someone
Who only accepts you

Rejection's a lesson you've had
You're lost in the anger you feel for your dad
But oh, how he loves you
There's no doubt with all his high hopes for you

I could push you away
I could say, ""I don't want you no more""
I could drive you right into the floor
And tell you are useless

Get used to it, lady
But I'm big in believing that, baby
You're bigger than that
It's respect for yourself that you lack

And success, it's a mood
That you chose with every step

I want to grow old with you
To hold your old hand
And look back on our youth
I will be strong, times I might not
I'm only human

I could push you away
I could say, ""I don't want you no more""
I could drive you right into the floor
And tell you are useless

Get used to it, lady
But I'm big in believing that, baby
You're bigger than that
It's respect for yourself that you lack

And success it's a mood
That you chose with every step

So, be free like a bumble bee
Spread wings like a bird
Squawk like a peacock
And let your voice be heard

It's okay
I have no lock, key or a cage
You've got to want to stay

I won't push you away
I won't say I don't want you no more
I won't drive you right into the floor
But I'll tell you you're beautiful

Get on with it, lady
'Cause I'm big in believing that, baby
You're bigger than that
It's respect for yourself that you lack

And success, it's a mood
That you chose with every step

Anytime I try and come to some conclusion
I'm only faced with confusion, confusion

Welcome to a generation spent !
We're all dead and spent
Welcome to a generation spent !
We're all dead and spent
Dead and spent
Dead and spent

Everybody's disillusioned with religion
No one really wants to talk about or question God
You're only someone if you're seen on television
I would love to sit back and turn the whole world off

Cause I don't wanna be the victim of our culture
Giving money to a people I'm ashamed of
I'm happiest when reality is dreamed up
To socialise is to compromise myself

Welcome to a generation spent !

Welcome to a generation spent !

And helplessly, I've fallen like a child
Hopelessly, I'm hoping you're the one for me
You comfort me, with every certain smile

But we have only just begun
Still so much for us to learn
Give and take, let's take our time
Taking turns in touching

Nowhere that I'd rather be
Than with you making history
Close your eyes, I'll close mine
And learn to love you

All of me, you found your way to all of me
And, helplessly, I've fallen like a child
Hopelessly, I'm hoping you're the one for me
You comfort me with every certain smile

But we have only just begun
Still so much for us to learn
Give and take, let's take our time
Taking turns in touching

Nowhere that I'd rather be
Than with you making history
Close your eyes, I'll close mine
And learn to love you

No one needs to know
If we chose to run away
Far from here

No one cares
But we have only just begun
For each other here
Still so much for us to learn

And no one shares
Give and take, let's take our time
Words we need to hear
Taking turns in touching

We take what we want
Nowhere that I'd rather be
And turn our backs on it all
Than with you making history

Life is sweet
Close your eyes , I'll close mine
'Cause we've got it all
All of me

But who knows love
You found your way to all of me
As necessity?
An helplessly

And who knows
I'm falling like a child
Fear as reality?

It's all mixed in the high streets shops
Where you think you're smart
'Cause the price is cut
But two for one never means too much
'Cause it's all on tap and you're in the clutch

Of society boasting beautiful
With the guarantee its ephemeral
You can see right through
It's not made to last
It's a precious lie with a heart of glass"

Que je voudrais te dire
Listen up ! Ã‚Â¡Ecoute ! Ã‚Â¡Important !
Te quiero mucho. La chica mÃƒÂ¡s linda

Oh no, that's EspaÃƒÂ±ol!
I gotta whole lotta lovin'
On the tip of my tongue

But the words won't come
Like I want them to come
I'm like Old Mother Hubbard
Getting lost in her cupboard
And now I think I'm losing you

So give me one more chance
Let me try to explain
I've got the words in my heart
But not in my brain

And now I'm all tongue tied
But at least I tried
To build a little bridge to you

In a moment of weakness
I give up on the romance
And I fall for a clichÃƒÂ©
But without thinking I say
""Ã‚Â¿Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir ?""

But you turn your back
And come back with a slap
I gotta whole lotta lovin'
On the tip of my tongue

But the words won't come
Like I want them to come
I'm like Old Mother Hubbard
Getting lost in her cupboard
And now I think I'm losing you

So give me one more chance
Let me try to explain
I've got the words in my heart
But not in my brain

And now I'm all tongue tied
But at least I tried
To build a little bridge to you

I build a little bridge to you
I said, I build a little bridge to you"
432,Folk,Charlie Winston,Hobo ,Calling Me ,"I heard you calling me
As I was swept away deeper into the sea
In love, I missed it's treachery ; swimming free
An in one breath a twist of fate made history
Mother nature took me in
She swept me under then I knew this was my end
My whole life flashed in front of me, so suddenly
And sinking down I knew I still could hear your scream !

I hear you calling me
There's nothing I can do
I hear you calling me
To answer back to you

An now you're loosing sleep
With memories you spend all night playing hide and seek
Replaying how it should have been and could have been
If only there were omens that you could have seen
Back in that room again
You hope to reach me through a medium
But there is no use ; I can't reply to this lover's cry
Oh ! How I wish I just could see you
One more time to say goodbye.

I hear you calling me
There's nothing I can do 

I hear you calling me
To answer back to you

I hear you calling me
There's nothing I can do
I hear you calling me
To answer back to you

I hear you calling me
There's nothing I can do
I hear you calling me
To answer back to you"
433,Folk,Charlie Winston,Hobo ,Boxes ,"As a child with ocean eyes I smiled
At a world existing just for me ;
Without boxes, borders or boundaries
I built dreams ;
But like plastic building blocks
They were knocked down the ground
I grew up
To a world of compromise
Analising what it means to dream

I don't really wanna understand
Everything in my world
It spoils the fun for me
Come on darling you can take my hand
Blowing kisses in the wind
We'll fly away in our dreams
From the boxes they'll put us in

Who shall we propose to be ?
Who am I supposed to be ?
With these empty building blocks
I could make a thousand me's

I don't really wanna understand
Everything in my world
It spoils the fun for me
Come on darling you can take my hand
Blowing kisses in the wind
We'll fly away in our dreams
From the boxes they'll put us in

And I'm told we all fit in
But why should I belong to one thing ?
Who shall we propose to be ?
Who I am supposed to be ? 

With these plastic building blocks
I could make a thousand me's

I don't really wanna understand
Everything in my world
It spoils the fun for me
Come on darling you can take my hand
Blowing kisses in the wind
We'll fly away in our dreams
From the boxes they'll put us in"
434,Folk,Charlie Winston,Hobo ,My Life As A Duck ,"They laugh at me and my life
My life as a duck ;
But I don't get worked up -
It's my life as a duck

You may think this is funny ;
You may think I had bad luck ;
Or did you think that I was stuck,
In my life as a duck ?

For all my life I've tried to hide
The animal in me
Now it's time to open up
and breath, and breath

I don't know where I am going
Or from which place I have come.
But as long as I am floating
The don't can be undone

You must be thinking ""what is he on ?""
But things are looking up
I've started to believe in living
My life as a duck

For all my life I've tried to hide
The animal in me
Now it's time to open up
and breath , and breath

So listen !
I know everything about you
Your father was a duck 

I know everything about you
Your father was a duck
I know everything about you
Your father was a duck
I know everything about you
Your father

For all my life I've tried to hide
The animal in me
Now it's time to open up and breath."
435,Folk,Charlie Winston,Hobo ,I Love Your Smile ,"Darling, I hate to see you 
So angry with the world
If people want a piece of you
Then they're missing something for themselves.

Maybe it's selfish of me 
to look at you and say
""Come back to me girl 
I love and I'll stay.

Coz I love your smile
Yes, I love your smile
How I love your smile
More than you know

Sometimes I might seem cold 
holding back my sympathies
For people stories people tell
Can so easily be believed.
The truth gets so distorted 
when everyone knows best
And sadness tends to find his friends
On the road to righteousness -
Darling, let's never be a part of that

Coz I love your smile
I love your smile
Girl,I love your smile
More than you know

I don't know why
a laugh is hard to find
could it be all of our fears
that we hide behind?
Like bricks in the wall
I wanna see them
fall down!

Coz I love your smile
Yes, I love your smile
Girl, I love your smile
More than you know

Hey hey hey
I love your smile
Girl,I love your smile
Well I love your smile
More than you know

Well, I love your smile
Cause I love smile, baby
You know what I mean"

To a tune with a rhythm like this
Would it be so unpopular for a singer
Like me to be bringing up the fact
That we're all gonna go?

Some people swear
They say they know
Where for me it's a mystery
But whichever way you see it
You have to admit it
And live it and live it

We all kick the bucket

All the girls kick the bucket
In the end, the end

And the boys kick the bucket
In the end, the end
Yep, we all kick the bucket
In the end the end
The end, the end, the end

Blew up my T.V., it' was numbing
My brain to be thinking
The same as million other
People all feeling
Afraid of the same thing

But there's nothing to lose
'Cause we're all on a bike
And we're cycling through
Getting off on our injuries

But you gotta get back on it
And live it and live it to love it
And live and love life

'Cause we all kick the bucket
In the end, the end
All the girls kick the bucket
In the end, the end

And the boys kick the bucket
In the end my friend
Yep We all kick the bucket
In the end, the end, the end
The end, the end

This is not a sad song
I don't bring it up to get you down
It's a celebration for all the red cells
Going round and round in your body

I don't mean to preach
Or to sound like a teacher
No I only wanna cut the crap
And looking back everybody's
Had to face the facts

That we all kick the bucket
In the end the end
All the girls kick the bucket
In the end the end

And the boys kick the bucket
In the end my friend
Yep, we all kick the bucket

Since I was a young boy
In this world, everything's
As good as bad
Now my father told me
Always speak a true word

And I have to say
That is the best advice I've had
Because something burns inside of me
It's everything I long to be and lies
They only stop me from feeling free

Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothing's gonna stop me
Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothing's gonna stop me

I've never yearned
For anybody's fortune
The less I have the more
I am a happy man

Now my mother told me
Always keep your head on
Because some may praise you just
To get what they want

And I said, ""Mama, I am not afraid
They will take what they will take
And what would life be like
Without a few mistakes""

Nothing's gonna stop me

Nothing's gonna stop me"

Each had a wooden horse
Gaily they played each summers day
Warriors both of cause

One little chap then had a mishap
Broke off his horses head
Wept for his toy, then cried with joy
As his young playmate said

Did you think I would leave you crying?
When there's room on my horse for two
Climb up here, Jack and don't be crying
I can go just as fast with two

When we grow up we'll both be soldiers
And our horses will not be toys
And I wonder if we'll remember when we were
Two little boys

Long years past, war came so fast
Bravely they marched away
Cannon roared loud and in the mad crowd
Wounded and dieing lie, up goes a shout

A horse dashes out
Out from the ranks so blue
Gallops away to where Joe lay
Then came a voice he know

Did you think I would leave you dying?
When there's room on my horse for two
Climb up here, Joe we'll soon be flying
I can go just as fast with two

Did you say Joe, I'm all a tremble?
Perhaps it's the battles noise
But I thinks it's that I remember
When we were two little boys

Do you think I would leave you dying?
There's room on my horse for two
Climb up here, Joe we'll soon be flying
Back to the ranks so blue

Can you feel Joe, I'm all a tremble?
Perhaps it's the battles noise
But I think it's that I remember
When we were two little boys"

There's an old Australian stockman, er, rock band 
Trying, but dying 
They get themselves up onto their collective elbows 
Revert to their sixties instrumentation 
And they try again 

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

When she gets there she knows, if those stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for 
All together now, with a word she can get what she came for 

Ooh and it makes me wonder

'Cos you know words sometimes have two meanings

Someone's Pinched Me Winkles
============================================
Rolf Harris - Someone's Pinched Me Winkles
============================================

The Cockney tribes in Britain were meeting for the games
Held annually, once a year, along the River Thames,
The scene was quiet and peaceful, the snow lay on the ground
The Cockneys by their cooking pots were huddled all around.
The chief was in his tepee his face all lined with wrinkles
When up the river came the cry
""someone's pinched me winkles!""
Me winkles have been pinched (oobie dooby) me winkles have been pinched,
Now some people say it's a load of old nonsense but a winkle's got a lot of vitamin contents
Never win that race tomorrow I'll be a big disgrace tomorrow
I'll search the blinking place tomorrow, but tomorrow is too late
Some rotter's pinched me winkles off me plate.
(I turned round and wheeeet, they were gone)

The tears of sheer frustration started trickling down his face, well
He'd set his heart on winning in the gruelling barrow race,
Without his final winkle feed his training scheme was shot
He staggered round the camp ground shouting ""someone's pinched the lot""

Me winkles have been pinched (oobie dooby) me winkles have been pinched
Beef or carrots or a dash of cucumber 
As far as I'm concerned that's a load of old lumber
I'll never win the race tomorrow, he's got me in disgrace tomorrow
He'd better not show his face tomorrow, he'll end up in a fight
But me I need them winkles here tonight.
(now I want 'em, now, not tomorrow or the next day)

They called the wise old medicine man who shuffled up and said
""I'm levying a winkle tax one winkle each per head""
They made a grand collection from every tucker pot
Then stood around, the shells and all, they made me eat the lot

I've got me winkles back (oobie dooby) I've got me winkles back
Now I know I've been grumping and grousing
But I never thought I'd get two or three thousand
I'll never win that race tomorrow, I can't go in that race tomorrow
I couldn't stand the pace tomorrow, I'm much to blinking fat
I'll never face a winkle after that.
Phew - I think I'll go and try out something new, you know, just to see how it feels
I think I'll have a dash at some jellied eels.

(Excuse me a minute while I just get this newspaper off this bit of jellied eel here).
Mmm - that's lovely;
Here, you with the winkle barrow, ""hello"" 
as far as I'm concerned you can stick your perishing winkles right... back in the sea
- it's jellied eels for me."
445,Folk,Rolf Harris,Miscellaneous ,Six White Boomers ,"Early on one Christmas Day a Joey Kangaroo
Was far from home and lost in a great big zoo
Mummy, where's my mummy? They've taken her away
We'll help you find your mummy, son, hop up on the sleigh

Up beside the bag of toys little Joey hopped
But they hadn't gone far when Santa stopped
Unharnessed all the reindeer and Joey wondered why
Then he heard a far off booming in the sky

Six white boomers, snow white boomers
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun
Six white boomers, snow white boomers
On his Australian run

Pretty soon old Santa began to feel the heat
Took his fur lined boots off to cool his feet
Into one popped Joey, feeling quite okay
While those old man kangaroos kept pulling on the sleigh

Six white boomers, snow white boomers
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun
Six white boomers, snow white boomers
On his Australian run

Joey said to Santa, ""Santa, what about the toys?
Aren't you giving some to these girls and boys?""
They've got all their presents, son, we were here last night
This trip is an extra trip, Joey's special flight

Six white boomers, snow white boomers
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun
Six white boomers, snow white boomers
On his Australian run

Soon the sleigh was flashing past right over Marble Bar
""Slow down there"", cried Santa, ""It can't be far""
Come up on my lap here, son, and have a look around
There she is, that's mummy, bounding up and down

Six white boomers, snow white boomers
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun
Six white boomers, snow white boomers
On his Australian run

Well, that's the bestest Christmas treat that Joey ever had
Curled up in mother's pouch feeling snug and glad
The last they saw was Santa heading northwards from the sun
The only year the boomers worked a double run

Six white boomers, snow white boomers
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun
Six white boomers, snow white boomers
On his Australian run"

But it always has been perilous
Crossing the arena to the supermarkets
Where I buy my cheese
It's regularly perilous

And this day I was wearing my red

That because I am small
I am puny
You are wrong
I stood my ground
I did not move
I could not move

The picador's horse was standing on my tail
So swiftly I turned and I nipped him in the fetlocks
He was most embarrassed
But for the moment I was free

I pirouette to safety and the bull thunders past me
Brrrah
Then, I hear the trumpet call for the death
I have resolved to dispatch Senor Toros
With the classic pass of the dead one

The crowd screamed, ""No, no""
But I plant my feet firmly, one and two
Three, four

Then from ten yards away
I called the bull to me, Toros
He comes rushing towards me

I tripped him

======================

Jumbuk, Jumbuk, It's got to be a sin,
That you can't go back and start your life again.
I used to be a shearer, woo-ba-deep-ba-dee-dum,
Shore one fifty odd a day.
I was never a 'top gun' shearer but I'll tell you this, I earned my pay.
I miss those wooly jumbuks, I miss their jumbuk smell,
It'll never be the same here without 'em, mate,
They don't shear sheep in hell, 
No, they shear no sheep in hell.
Jumbuk, jumbuk, the wool rolls off the shears,
Jumbuk, jumbuk, sheep as big as steers.
I got a kick in the eye from one, ooh!
One poked me under the chin, ssss!
Jumbuk, jumbuk, it's got to be a sin,
That there's only skin and bone between the ears.
You'd hear the sound of bleating, baaa-ba-deep-ba-dee-dum,
And every pen was full.
You;d drag out a sheep and start your run
With the one straight cut down the belly wool.
I miss that concentration,
I miss the noise as well.
You could never find a job that'll match it, mate,
They don't shear sheep in hell,
No, they shear no sheep in hell.

You wanna watch those sheep slide down the chute,
One by one as they're done, they're all huddled there, all thin and bare, all shivering in the sun.
And your aching back you've gotta just ignore, you;re tryin' to pace yourself up against the 'gun,'
You keep snatchin' a look at your clock on the wall,
Timing your run.

And when the contract's over, woo-ba-deep-ba-dee-dum,
There's nothing left to tell.
Hang up your shears and crack a smile, but gee it's hard, that last farewell.
I miss those jolly jumbuks more than I can tell.
You can never get the same satisfaction, mate,
They don't shear sheep in hell, 
No, they shear no sheep in hell.

Jumbuk, jumbuk, the wool rolls off the shears.
Jumbuk, jumbuk, Sheep as big as steers.
I got a kick in the eye from one,
Didn't mind it at all.

Jumbuk, jumbuk, it's got to be a sin,
That you can't go back and start it all again.
Gee, I'd love to live my shearing days again.

With my extra leg, deedle, eedle, eedle, um
Wherever I go through rain and snow, the people always let me know
There's Jake the Peg, deedle, eedle, eedle, um
With his extra leg, deedle, eedle, eedle, um

I had a dreadful childhood, really, I suppose I shouldn't moan
Each time they had a three legged race, I won it on my own
And also I got popular when came the time for cricket
They used to roll my trousers up and use me for the wicket

I'm Jake the Peg, deedle, eedle, eedle, um
With my extra leg, deedle, eedle, eedle, um
Wherever I go through rain and snow, the people always let me know
There's Jake the Peg, deedle, eedle, eedle, um
With his extra leg, deedle, eedle, eedle, um

I was a dreadful scholar, I found all the lessons hard
The only thing I knew for sure was three feet make a yard
To count to ten I used my fingers if I needed more
By getting my shoes and socks of, I could count to twenty-four

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

I'm Jake the Peg, deedle, eedle, eedle, um
With my extra leg, deedle, eedle, eedle, um

Whatever I did they said was false
They said, ""Quick march"", I did a quick waltz
Then they shouted at me, ""Put your best foot forward""
""But which foot?"" I said
'It's very fine for you, you only got a choice of two but me""

I'm Jake the Peg, deedle, eedle, eedle, um
With my extra leg, deedle, eedle, eedle, um"

Rolf Harris - I've Lost My Mummy
==================================

Just like the inside of any big shop,
People were ev'rywhere.
Suddenly business was brought to a stop when a terrible yell hit the air.
I've lost my mummy, ah-ah-ah-ah, I've lost my mummy.
I've lost my mummy, ah-ah-ah-ah, I've lost my mummy.

People all gathered to look at the lad,
Patted him on the head.
'Where was your mummy when you saw her last?'
Turning to her the boy said:

I've lost my mummy, ah-ah-ah-ah, I've lost my mummy.
I've lost my mummy, ah-ah-ah-ah, I've lost my mummy.

Down came the manager to fix up the mess,
Took the small boy aside
'Come on now, lad, let's have your name and address.'
With a lungful of air he replied:

I've lost my mummy, ah-ah-ah-ah, I've lost my mummy.
I've lost my mummy, ah-ah-ah-ah, I've lost my mummy.

Just then his mother appeared on the spot,
Gave him a hefty whack.
'That ought to teach you to go and get lost!'
And the little boy's voice floated back:

I've found my mummy, ah-ah-ah-ah, I've found my mummy.
I've found my mummy, ah-ah-ah-ah, I've found my mummy."

Burgular Bold
=============================
Rolf Harris - Burgular Bold
=============================

I'll sing you a song of a burgular bold, who tried to rob a house.
He open'd the window and crept right in, as quiet as a mouse.
He said to himself, 'I'll hide away 'til ev'ryone is asleep.
Then, quick as a flash, I'll take their cash and out of the house I'll creep.
So he hid himself right under the bed, hard up against the wall.
But he hadn't a clue who owned the place or he'd never have stayed at all.
He never thought, well he never knew as under the bed he lay,
That in the night he'd see a sight that'd turn all his hair to grey.

At nine o'clock the owner came in, 'I'm tired as tired,' she said.
And thinking that night that all was right, she didn't look under the bed.
She took out her teeth and her old glass eye and the hair from off her head.
And the burgular bold turned icy cold with panic beneath the bed.

He waited for hours, then out he crept, he felt a total wreck.
But the old maid, she was still awake and she grabbed him by the neck.
She never screamed or fainted away but calm as any clam,
She said 'My prayers are answered, oh thank heaven, I've found a man.'

She whipped a revolver from under the pillow and to the burgular said,
'Young fellow, you'll have to marry me now or I'll blow off the top of your head!'
She held him tight and the burgular knew there wasn't a chance to scoot.
He looked at her teeth and he heaved a sigh at the ghastly wig and the old glass eye,
the coy little smile, the provocative pose, and the varicose veins on the end of her nose.
He said 'Lady, for Pete's sake, shoot!'"

Farewell to old England forever,
Farewell to you numb-skulls as well.
And farewell to the well-known Old Bailey
Where I always did look such a swell.
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ay,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
And I'll see you in Botany Bay.

Now my crime against the whole British Nation
Was to take some dry bread one fine day,
T'was death, or it was transportation,
So they tossed up a coin and sent me away.

Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ay,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
And I'll see you in Botany Bay.

Now there's the Captain, he's our commander,
There's the bosun and all of the crew,
There's the first and second class passengers,
Know what we poor convicts go through.

Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ay,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
And I'll see you in Botany Bay.

Now take warning you Dukes and you Duchesses,
Pay close attention to what I say.
Just make sure it's you own what you touchesses,
Or you'll join us in Botany Bay.

Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ay,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
And I'll see you in Botany Bay.

And I'll see you in Botany Bay."
452,Folk,Rolf Harris,Miscellaneous ,Big Dog ,"This great big wolf hound's standing staring at me
Licking his chops and weighing me up for tea
I'm a guy who don't scare easily
That's the truth, Cor, look at that tooth
And he's just standing, slobbering and panting, looking at me

They never had this great dog here yesterday
Her old man's bought him just to scare me away
I bet he's in there laughing, shouting hooray
And I'm scared to death and puppy dog's breath
Is coming faster, it's gonna be disaster, I daren't run away

Her dad's got a right to object to the way I dress
I guess, but to buy a huge pup to tear me up
Look his jaws and his paws and his maws all wet
It's not sweat, it's saliva and he'll be the sole survivor
That's pure vindictiveness

So, when his great mastiff has torn me limb from limb
What'll his precious daughter think about him?
I'm not very bright but I'm certainly not that dim
You see, then, her father, he will have made me a martyr
(You see)
And when me head's been torn to shreds, she's gonna blame him

Sounds gory, don't it? I've turned green
Still I might as well go in a blaze of glory
If you know what I mean
Just the same, I wish I had the courage to run
Either that or I wish I had a dirty great gun

Well, if I really gotta die then I better get it over and done
Cor, that dog's immense, still here I go over the fence
Go on, dog, go on, treat me as lunch meat
Savage me and crunch me, here's me foot, have fun"

Here's a question. 
Go ahead and ask it.
What saved Moses in his little basket, 
When the murky water mighta sunk it?
God's will and a little wooly blanket.
What? Yes! Made of
Wool-o, wool-o, woolly woolly wool-o,
White and light and bright and beautiful-o.
Pure wool, so dependable-o, whoo,
From the lamb, from the ram, and from the ewe-hoo-hoo

What made Meshak and Abednigo-ho,
When the fiery flames were all a-glow-ho,
Sit there in that furnace brave and daring?
Faith in God and the shirts that they were wearing.
What? Yes! Made of

Wool-o, wool-o, woolly woolly wool-o,
White and light and bright and beautiful-o.
Pure wool, so dependable-o, whoo,
From the lamb, from the ram, and from the ewe-hoo-hoo

Good book says and we believe it's so-ho
Joshua fought the fight of Jericho-ho.
Wall so high that nobody could jump it,
Josh brought it down with his little silver trumpet.
What? Yes!
(spoken out of tempo)
What did you think it would be made of?

Wool-o, wool-o, woolly woolly wool-o,
White and light and bright and beautiful-o.
Pure wool, so dependable-o, whoo,
From the lamb, from the ram, and from the ewe-hoo-hoo

If you want to put a bit of style on,
Don't go buying polythene or nylon.
Patent leather's really rather drastic,
Might as well get imitation plastic
What? No! Stick to

Wool-o, wool-o, woolly woolly wool-o,
White and light and bright and beautiful-o.
Pure wool, so dependable-o, whoo,
From the lamb, from the ram, and from the ewe-hoo-hoo"

Stranger Song

It's true that all the men you knew were dealers 
who said they were through with dealing 
Every time you gave them shelter 
I know that kind of man 
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone 
who is reaching for the sky just to surrender, 
who is reaching for the sky just to surrender. 
And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind 
you find he did not leave you very much 
not even laughter 
Like any dealer he was watching for the card 
that is so high and wild 
he'll never need to deal another 
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger 
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger 

And then leaning on your window sill 
he'll say one day you caused his will 
to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter 
And then taking from his wallet 
an old schedule of trains, he'll say 
I told you when I came I was a stranger 
I told you when I came I was a stranger. 

But now another stranger seems 
to want you to ignore his dreams 
as though they were the burden of some other 
O you've seen that man before 
his golden arm dispatching cards 
but now it's rusted from the elbows to the finger 
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter 
Yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter. 

Ah you hate to see another tired man 
lay down his hand 
like he was giving up the holy game of poker 
And while he talks his dreams to sleep 
you notice there's a highway 
that is curling up like smoke above his shoulder. 
It is curling just like smoke above his shoulder. 

You tell him to come in sit down 
but something makes you turn around 
The door is open you can't close your shelter 
You try the handle of the road 
It opens do not be afraid 
It's you my love, you who are the stranger 
It's you my love, you who are the stranger. 

Well, I've been waiting, I was sure 
we'd meet between the trains we're waiting for 
I think it's time to board another 
Please understand, I never had a secret chart 
to get me to the heart of this 
or any other matter 
When he talks like this 
you don't know what he's after 
When he speaks like this, 
you don't know what he's after. 

Let's meet tomorrow if you choose 
upon the shore, beneath the bridge 
that they are building on some endless river 
Then he leaves the platform 
for the sleeping car that's warm 
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter 
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger 
And you say ok the bridge or someplace later. 

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind ... 

And leaning on your window sill ... 

I told you when I came I was a stranger."

I've lost my wife and children

An old woman gave us shelter
Kept us hidden in the garret
Then the soldiers came
She died without a whisper

I'm the only one this evening
But I must go on
The frontiers are my prison

And I, I put it in your little shoe
And then I confess that I tortured the dress
That you wore for the world to look through

I showed my heart to the doctor
He said, I just have to quit
Then he wrote himself a prescription
Your name was mentioned in it

Then he locked himself into a library shelf
Oh, with all of the details of our, our shabby honeymoon
And I hear from his nurse, she adds this, he gotten much worse
And his, his practice is fallen to ruin

And I heard of the saint who had loved you
I studied all night in his school
He taught that the duty of lovers
Is to tarnish the, the golden rule

And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure
He went and drowned himself in the pool
His body is gone, yeah but back here on the lawn
His spirit continues to drool

An Eskimo showed me that movie
He'd recently taken of you
While the poor man could hardly stop shivering
His lips, his fingers were blue

I suppose he froze when the wind tore off your clothes
And I, I guess he just never got warm
But you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice
Oh please, let me come into the storm

When you choose the precious few
Who've left their pride on the other side

Even in your arms

To kneel grotesque and bare

For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

When He walked upon the water
And He spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower

And when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could see Him
He said, ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""

But He Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

You fixed yourself, you said, ""Well, never mind""
We are ugly but we have the music

And then you got away, didn't you, baby?
Ah, you just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you, I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, my little darling, I don't even think of you that often"
469,Folk,Leonard Cohen,Miscellaneous ,Since You've Asked (Dialogue) ,"What I'll give you since you asked is all my time together
Take the rugged sunny days, the warm and rocky weather
Take the roads that I have walked along
Looking for tomorrow's time, peace of mind

As my life spills into yours changing with the hours
Filling up the world with time, turning time to flowers
I can show you all the songs
That I never sang to one man before

We have seen a million stones lying by the water
You have climbed the hills with me to the mountain shelter
Taken off the days one by one
Setting them to breathe in the sun

Take the lilies and the lace from the days of childhood
All the willow winding paths leading up and outward
This is what I give
This is what I ask you for nothing more"
470,Folk,Leonard Cohen,Miscellaneous ,The Great Event ,"It's going to happen very soon
The great event, which will end the horror
Which will end the sorrow
Next Tuesday when the sun goes down

I will play the Moonlight Sonata backwards
This will reverse the effects of the world's mad plunge
Into suffering, for the last 200 million years
What a lovely night that would be

What a sigh of relief, as the senile robins
Become bright red again, and the retired nightingales
Pick up their dusty tails, and assert the Majesty of Creation"
471,Folk,Leonard Cohen,Miscellaneous ,Bird on the Wire ,"Like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free

Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee

If I, if I have been unkind
I hope that you can just let it go by
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you

Oh, like a baby, stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me

But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Oh, like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free"

I Came So Far For Beauty

I came so far for beauty 
I left so much behind 
My patience and my family 
My masterpiece unsigned 
I thought I'd be rewarded 
For such a lonely choice 
And surely she would answer 
To such a very hopeless voice 
I practiced all my sainthood 
I gave to one and all 
But the rumours of my virtue 
They moved her not at all 
I changed my style to silver 
I changed my clothed to black 
And where I would surrender 
Now I would attack 
I stormed the old casino 
For the money and the flesh 
And I myself decided 
What was rotten and what was fresh 
And men to do my bidding 
And broken bones to teach 
The value of my pardon 
The shadow of my reach 
But no, I could not touch her 
With such a heavy hand 
Her star beyond my order 
Her nakedness unmanned 
I came so far for beauty 
I left so much behind 
My patience and my family 
My masterpiece unsigned"

The Night Comes On

I went down to the place 
Where I knew she lay waiting 
Under the marble and the snow 
I said, Mother I'm frightened 
The thunder and the lightning 
I'll never come through this alone 
She said, I'll be with you 
My shawl wrapped around you 
My hand on your head when you go 
And the night came on 
It was very calm 
I wanted the night to go on and on 
But she said, Go back to the World 
We were fighting in Egypt 
When they signed this agreement 
That nobody else had to die 
There was this terrible sound 
And my father went down 
With a terrible wound in his side 
He said, Try to go on 
Take my books, take my gun 
Remember, my son, how they lied 
And the night comes on 
It's very calm 
I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong 
But you don't want to lie, not to the young 

We were locked in this kitchen 
I took to religion 
And I wondered how long she would stay 
I needed so much 
To have nothing to touch 
I've always been greedy that way 
But my son and my daughter 
Climbed out of the water 
Crying, Papa, you promised to play 
And they lead me away 
To the great surprise 
It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes 
And they hide, they hide in the World 

Now I look for her always 
I'm lost in this calling 
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer 
Saying, When will she summon me 
When will she come to me 
What must I do to prepare 
When she bends to my longing 
Like a willow, like a fountain 
She stands in the luminous air 
And the night comes on 
And it's very calm 
I lie in her arms and says, When I'm gone 
I'll be yours, yours for a song 

Now the crickets are singing 
The vesper bells ringing 
The cat's curled asleep in his chair 
I'll go down to Bill's Bar 
I can make it that far 
And I'll see if my friends are still there 
Yes, and here's to the few 
Who forgive what you do 
And the fewer who don't even care 
And the night comes on 
It's very calm 
I want to cross over, I want to go home 
But she says, Go back, go back to the World"

Here comes your bride with her veil on
Approach her, you wretch, if you dare
Approach her, you ape with your tail on

Each man beneath his ordinary load

""I'd like to tell my story""
Said one of them so young and bold
""I'd like to tell my story
Before I turn into gold""

But no one really could hear him
The night so dark and thick and green
Well, I guess that these heroes must always live there
Where you and I have only been

Put out your cigarette, my love
You've been alone too long
And some of us are very hungry now
To hear what it is you've done that was so wrong

I sing this for the crickets
I sing this for the army
I sing this for your children
And for all who do not need me

But you called me and I folded like you knew I'd do
You called my ace, my king, my bluff

Okay, you win, enough's enough

I was never any good at loving you

I was pretty good at taking out the garbage
Pretty good at holding up the wall
Dealing with the fire and the earthquake
But that don't count that don't count
That don't count for nothing much at all

I was never any good at loving you
I was just a tourist in your bed looking at the view
But I can't forget where my lips have been

Those holy hills that deep ravine
I was never any good, never any good
I was never any good at loving you

I was pretty good at taking out the garbage
Pretty good at holding up the wall
I'm sorry for my crimes against the moonlight
I didn't think, I didn't think
I didn't think the moon would mind at all

I was never any good at loving you
At doing what a woman really wants a man to do

I love you too in all your forms
The slim and lovely virgin floating among German beer
The mean governess of the huge pink maps
The solitary mourner of a prince

Queen Victoria, I am cold and rainy
I am dirty as a glass roof in a train station
I feel like an empty cast iron exhibition
I want ornaments on everything
Because my love, she gone with other boys

Queen Victoria, do you have a punishment under the white lace
Will you be short with her? Will you make her read those little Bibles
Will you spank her with a mechanical corset?
I want her pure as power, I want her skin slightly musty with petticoats
Will you wash the easy bidet out of her head?

Queen Victoria, I'm not much nourished by modern love
Will you come into my life, with your sorrow and your black carriages
And your perfect memories?

Queen Victoria, the twentieth century belongs to you and me
Let us be two severe giants not less lonely for our partnership
Who discolor test tubes in the halls of science
Who turn up unwelcome at every world's fair

Heavy with proverbs and corrections
Confusing the star-dazed tourists
With our incomparable sense of loss"

How come you bother with this old heart at all?
You raise me up in grace
Then you put me in a place where I must fall

It's too late to mix another drink
All the lights are going out
I'll just listen to the darkness sing
Oh, I know what that's all about

I tried to love you my way
But I couldn't make it hold
So I closed the book of longing
And I do what I am told

I wouldnt hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you (oooh, oooh)

Love is not a gadget
Love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
She'll fill your heart with joy

Oh, what I'd give if I could see.
Am I the boy that you care for,
The boy who's in your diary?

Do you recall and make note of all
The little things I say and do?
The name you underline, I'm hoping that it's mine.

I'm evil to the core, What I shouldn't do I will
They say I'm emotional, What I want to save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am?, I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat, And repeat yesterday's dance
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral

The world around us is burning but we're so cold

I know who I truly am, I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat, To avoid yesterday's dance
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we're so cold

But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They think this thing is a highway
If it was a highway
We'd have a tempo change every other time change
Cause our minds change on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music, I don't know how I would've fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest, there's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity is on the free when I'm playin' shows

They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
Will they be alive tomorrow?

I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat, in a gas mask
If you ask Zack, he's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's back track, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list
But the problem is
There's another list that exist and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my calvary

All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless

They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

Will they be alive tomorrow?
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)
Will they be alive tomorrow?

They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say, when you know it's not true
Even harder to write, when you know that's a lie
There were people back home who tried talking to you

""Who would you live for?""
""Who would you die for?""

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose, same clothes, home grown, the stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter

Down a route I think is heading south
But I'm not good with directions
And I hide behind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections
And I'm best friends with my doubt

You don't know what I've done
I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present
I'm obsessing, all these questions
Why I'm in denial
That they tried this suicidal session

Hope you're dead cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
People they rhyme like this
We're all impressed by this
They rip it, flip it but these are just triplets
Wrote this in three minutes
Three words to a line
It's just poetry divided
I'm the kind of guy
Who takes every moment
He knows he can fight it
And music to use it
For others to use it
You're dead cause how could you sleep at a time like this?

Life is up here but you comment below
When the comments will always become common
Motivation to promote your show's next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment
But you would not know it gets better
When morning finally rears its head
Together we'll lose this
Remember the future
Remember that morning is when night is dead

Release me from the present
I'm obsessing, all these questions
Why I'm in denial
That they tried this suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messing with the message man

Stop thinking about
The bullets from my mouth
I love the things you hate about yourself
Just finished a daydream
Who were you trying to be

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it
over it

No one wants you when you have no heart and
I'm sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
You'll never know if you don't ever try again
So let's try
Let's try

No liquor left on the shelf
I should probably introduce myself
You shoulda' seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five-thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough

(Don't think I'll ever get enough)
Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart

A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise hell and turn it up
Saying ""If you go on you might pass out in a drain pipe""

Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bedsheets and a morning rose
I wanna wake up
Can't even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbors pool
Upside-down with a perfect view?
Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown

Don't threaten me with a good time
I'm a scholar and a gentleman
And I usually don't fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
I told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
And we all fell down
When the sun came up

I think we've had enough

And clouds full of fear
And storms full of sorrow

Just typhoons and monsoons

And a coast that's unclear
All the guests at the party
They're so insincere
They just intrude and exclude

There's no you and me
This impossible year
Only heartache and heartbreak
And gin made of tears
The bitter pill I swallow
The scars souvenir
That tattoo, your last bruise
This impossible year

There's never air to breathe
There's never in-betweens

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become?
Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish 'em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

(Instrumental)

Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down
Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone the fear shall humble
Swallow all your pride

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!"

When reaper calls, may it be
That we walk straight and right

When doubt returns, may it be
That faith shall permeate our scars
When we’re seduced, then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever

When all is pain, may it be
It’s all we’ve ever known
When flame consumes, may it be
It warms our dying bones

When loss has won, may it be
It’s you I’m madly fighting for
When kingdom comes, may it be
We walk right through that open door

She builds up for destruction

Cause I’m surrounded by cowards
And I don’t give a fuck when I walk into battle
And thats why I got all the power
I’m where you wanna be
Ain’t no one ahead of me
All of my enemies made a decision
It's better to follow me
I make no apologies
All of my sins I would repeat and I repeat
Cause I'ma be me 'til the death of me, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I can smell your fear
The only reason that I’m here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I’ll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I’ll be back at it
Cause bad habits they die hard
We live fast we die hard
Go against me you’ll die hard
Die hard

[Verse 2]
I dine with the blood on my hands
Thrive when I’m beatin' the man
All I learned in the pen
Is never get caught
Just get out and hit it again
Straight outta context
Ain't see me come like it's phone sex
Ain't hear me tick like a Rolex
Cause I’m keepin' a nuclear conscience
I fly like an atom bomb
In a world riddled with conflict
Hate that you need me
Wanna destroy me but you can’t
You're gonna deploy me in the end
Better believe that I'ma be me 'til the death of me, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I can smell your fear
The only reason that I’m here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I’ll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I’ll be back at it
Cause bad habits they die hard
We live fast we die hard
Go against me you’ll die hard
Die hard

[Bridge]
And if love is real
Maybe I’m just too bad
To remember how good it feels
My heart is still

[Chorus]
I can smell your fear
The only reason that I’m here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I’ll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I’ll be back at it
Cause bad habits they die hard
We live fast we die hard
Go against me you’ll die hard
Die hard"

Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks – (*record scratch*)

'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants ta
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (heyyy!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits; fuck you, Debbie!

[Hook: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!!!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {​​smack}​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass; you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Hook: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking ""this shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me!
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
(Heyyy!) There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

[Hook: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

Woah, let's go
But I'm Gerald and I can always have just what I want
She's that baddest I would love to flaunt
Take her shopping, you know Yves Saint Laurent
But nope, she ain't with it though
All because she got her own dough
Boss bossed if you don't know
She could never ever be a broke ho

[Verse 4: G-Eazy]
Really though, honestly
I get bored of basic bitches
She's the baddest, straight up vicious, texting her and asking her
If she's alone and if she'd sent some pictures, she said no (what)
Well goddamn, she said come over and see it for yourself
Never asking for your help, independent woman
She ain't for the shelf
No, she's the one
Smoke with her till the weed is gone
Stayin' up until we see the sun
Baddest ever, I swear she do it better than I've ever seen it done
Never borrow, she ain't ever loan
That's when she told me she ain't never ever ever ever gonna be owned

[Verse 5: Grace]
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please

Niggas hatin', wait I'm doin' numbers
In they feelin's, tell 'em I say fuck 'em
Hold up, wait, tell 'em that I love 'em
We could go, we had a discussion
Fame tend to blind the people on the side of you like you never mean nothin'
Focus on brand new things
Tryna show my children how to hustle
Teach 'em how to trust one another
All we got is us and your mother
Fall down, get back up again
Lose it all right before you win
Kevin man, you messin' up your gift
Shit like this be hard to come again
Fall bad, I know I admit it
Real struggle, I don't ever quit it

Back when I ain't have a shit to give

I saw you standing in the rain
You were holding his hand
And I'll never be the same

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
You can see me on the riviera dressed like a Playboy
Or you can catch me up in Rivieras Tuesday night
Pillow fights with Dominican mothers
That's what happens when theres suede on the roof
Swervin' lane to lane in a coupe
Shit, if I crash it, I'll probably just leave it as a token
That your boy coulda died right there, no jokin'
Uh, eating well so my foot's swollen
Fuck it man I'm rollin', you rollin' or not?
The boat plane's waiting at the dock
I wonder if he let me fly it, but it's a long shot
The money eases everybody's mind
Put kids through school, new titties on wives
New tits for the mistress
Fuck it, new titties for everybody, it's Christmas, yeah

I saw you standing in the rain
You were holding his hand
And I'll never be the same no

I use milfhunter.com to ease the pain
It was ninety-two degrees with rain
Right before the seasons changed
On trees just a little bit of leaves remain
My heart broke when his cock was in your throat
But fuck that laid top out on the boat
Heard you fucked around at Philippine and 1 OAK
My man seen you both at the Sonoko
Kissing and touching, lied and said that this was your cousin
Shit, I should have known when you stole money
Bitch called the cop and rolled on me
So good, I got old money
To lay on any motherfucking beach on the planet
With equestrian colored salmon
We examine my life and make sure I'm never dumb again
But first, slide your panties to the side girl, I'm comin' in

You were holding his hand and I'll never be the same, no

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Locked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You're loving on the psychopath sitting next to you
You're loving on the murderer sitting next to you

But after all I've said, please don't forget

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You're loving on the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think “How did I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire

Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

I been riding 'round the city with my squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up take a step back, when we roll up, cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion

No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

I torture you, take my hand through the flames
I torture you, I'm just a sucker for pain

I bet a lot of me was lost, 't's uncrossed and 'i's undotted,
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got,
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat,
I must've forgot, you can't trust me,
I'm open a moment and close when you show it,
Before you know it I'm lost at sea,
And now that I write and think about it,
And the story unfolds,
You should take my life, you should take my soul.

You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,
You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

And I'll be holding on to you.

And I'll be holding on to you.

Remember the moment you know exactly where you're going,
'Cause the next moment, before you know it,
Time is slowing and it's frozen still,
And the window sill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night,
right? Fight it, take the pain, ignite it,
Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it,
To a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me,
This ain't a noose, this is a leash,
And I have some news for you, you must obey me.""

You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,
You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

Entertain my faith.

Entertain my faith.

Entertain my faith.

Entertain my faith.

Entertain my faith.

Entertain my faith.

Entertain my faith.

Entertain my faith.

554,Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Car Radio ,"I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
Cause somebody stole
My car radio

And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel

There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought

Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep - please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win
And fear will lose
There's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think

And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought

To replace that slot
With what I once bought
Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence"
555,Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Fake You Out ,"I want to drive away
In the night, headlights call my name

I, I'll never be, be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
Cause I am quiet now

And silence gives you space
I'll never be, be what you see inside

You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far
And I'll fall
And I'll break

And I'll fake
All I wanna
And I'll fall down
And I'll break down

And I'll fake you out
All I wanna
It's the same game today as it always is
I don't give these places fake my name explaining this
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
That remind me of all the times...
I have committed
Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted
To what I've done and what I'm doing
I'm brewing and losing and spewing infusing
And believe me that's what all the kids are doing
What kids are doing are killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner's cell
And if you're one of them then you're one of me
And you would do almost anything just to feel free...
Am I right? Of course I am
Convince me otherwise would take all night

Before you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say
Our brains are sick but that's okay
And I'll fall

And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna
All I wanna
Yeah, and I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

And I'll be holding on to you.

And I'll be holding on to you.

Remember the moment you know exactly where you're going
'Cause the next moment, before you know it
Time is slowing and it's frozen still
And the window sill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night
right? Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
To a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have some news for you, you must obey me.""

I don't want to be heard
I want to be listened to
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name?
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name?

I scream, you scream
We all scream 'cause we're terrified
Of what's around the corner
We stay in place
‘Cause we don't want to lose our lives

So let's think of something better.
Down in the forest we'll sing a
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote.

My brain has given up
White flags are hoisted
I took some food for thought
It might be poisoned
The stomach in my brain
Throws up on to the page
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name?
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name?

I scream, you scream
We all scream 'cause we're terrified
Of what's around the corner

So let's think of something better
Down in the forest
We'll sing a
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher

We'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote
Quickly moving towards a storm
Moving forward, torn
In to pieces over reasons
Of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that
When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light

Comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're suppose to be?
This is not what you're suppose to see
Please, remember me? I am suppose to be
King of a kingdom or swinging on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
This situation's becoming dire
My treehouse is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands

This is not what I had planned
This is not what I had planned.
Down in the forest
We'll sing a Hands held higher
We'll be on fire
Singin songs that nobody wrote
Down in the forest
We'll sing a
One that everybody knows

We'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

We'll be on fire

They will not cast you out.

Dear friend, here we are again pretending
To understand how you think your world is ending
Sending signals and red flags in waves
It's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days
I'll pray that one day you see
The only difference between life and dying
Is one is trying, that's all we're called to do
So try to love me and I'll try to save you.

I will make you believe you are lovely.

Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, my catastrophe
At my kitchen sink, you don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you
Is not a kitchen sink to me, ok friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah it might be worthless
Then paint something then, it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons
Meaning maybe defeating them
Could be the beginning of your meaning, friend

Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game and say
They know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say
They don't know you, and neither do I
So here's a prime example of a stand up guy
Who hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother and his head's screwed up
But that's alright.

Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moments mending memories
Pretending enemies are friend of me, sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
better I am, Gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Don't leave me alone

Culture forbids
We have romantic fantasies about what dying truly is
Fall off the grid.
We live for the night's decor
It reveals what we dream of.
I know there's someone at the door
They called for help, of this I'm sure
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes
I'm holding on to what I know
And what I know, I must let go
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.

I know some people who know people who are flying straight
But I'll kindly enter into rooms of depression
While ceiling fans and idle hands will take my life again.

Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist

Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone

I-I-I've got a migraine
and my pain will range from up down and sideways
thank God it's Friday
cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
cause Sunday's are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, cloud, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense
It's me suspended in a defenseless

test being tested by a ruthless examiner

that's represented best by my depress... ing thoughts
I do not have writers block

my writer just hates the clock
it will not let me sleep, I'll get some sleep when I'm dead

and sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

But I know we've made it this far, kid
yeah, yeah, yeah
I am not as fine as I seem pardon
Me for yelling I'm telling you green gardens
are not what's growing in my psyche
it's a different me
a difficult to be, stop feasting lumber down trees
freeze frame
please let me paint a mental picture portrait

something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
deny what is important, holds back contents
that make pandora's box contents' look non-violent

Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
my mind shipwrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions

They're trying to eat me blood running down their chin
and they know that I can fight or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
from all the pain our brain has made

the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
and keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone

Why it's got to be like this, is this living free
I don't want to be the one, be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands

Why am I not scared in the morning

Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone.

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant.
Please tell them you have no plans for me.
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?

And the trees they await and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling there's something we need
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time mvp'ed this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically I'm a whore, and that's denial number four.

Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote.

White flags are hoisted
I took some food for thought
It might be poisoned
The stomach in my brain
Throws up on to the page
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name?

Moving forward, torn
In to pieces over reasons
Of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that
When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light
Comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're suppose to be?
This is not what you're suppose to see
Please, remember me? I am suppose to be
King of a kingdom or swinging on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
This situation's becoming dire

Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat,
I must've forgot, you can't trust me,
I'm open a moment and close when you show it,
Before you know it I'm lost at sea,
And now that I write and think about it,
And the story unfolds,
You should take my life, you should take my soul.

You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,
You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

And I'll be holding on to you.

And I'll be holding on to you.

Remember the moment you know exactly where you're going,
'Cause the next moment, before you know it,
Time is slowing and it's frozen still,
And the window sill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night,
right? Fight it, take the pain, ignite it,
Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it,
To a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me,
This ain't a noose, this is a leash,
And I have some news for you, you must obey me.""

Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,
You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

Entertain my faith.

Entertain my faith.

Entertain my faith.

Entertain my faith.

But there's hope out the window,
So that's where we'll go,
Let's go outside and all join hands,
But until then you'll never understand.
That you all have guns,
And you never put the safety on,
And you all have plans,
To take it, don't take it.

We've turned our hands to guns, trade in our thumbs for ammunition,
I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition,
'Cause when the sun sets, it upsets what's left of my invested interest,
Interested in putting my fingers to my head,
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids,
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this,
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's,
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist."
582,Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Semi-Automatic ,"Night falls, with gravity.
The earth turns, from sanity
Taking my only friend I know
He leaves a lot, his name is Hope.

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided.
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.

The horrors of the night melt away
Under the warm glow of survival of the day
Then we move on
My shadow grows taller along with my fears
And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near

When the sun is coming, windowsills
And the silver lining rides the hills
I will be saved for one whole day
Until the sun make the hills its grave

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided.
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided.
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind.

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers schizophrenic
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on
By the time the night wears off, the dust is down

And shadows burn
I will rise and stand my ground
Waiting for the night's return.
I'm never what I like

I'm double-sided.
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.
I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided.
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind."

587,Rock,Twenty One Pilots,Vessel ,Car Radio - Live at The Newport Music Hall ,"I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my,
Too deep
Please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win
And fear will lose
There's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick on please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive a
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole

And now I just sit in silence"

Why ya calling me? ‘Cause I give you more

Inching past the daydreams, inching towards your bed
I hope you know I’ll go away if you don’t try
It’s time to open up and let me come inside

But I like your sweater
Like how you wear it loose

You got me on the moon

Floating on your rhythm
I think it’s almost 3
Now I smoked up all the weed
So you’re all that I can see

Boy your moves are poppin'
And everybody knows
That when you start hoppin’
The living room explodes

Now the room is swimming

Ran your fingers through my hair
Now we’re skipping down the stairs

Unexpected swagger, you could swing me ‘round forever
I don’t wanna say that I’ll be thinking 'bout you always
But I like the freaky dance we’re doing in the hallway

Running your mouth about the way that I’ve been living
Girl you just keep on digging
This gift just keeps on giving, if you're

Trying to cut me down, you better reconsider
You know my skin is thicker, so just
ease up off the trigger

You’ve been talking for so long
can’t you just leave me alone?

Stop - I don’t wanna hear it
You been talking too long
Stop - I don’t wanna hear it
You been singing that same sad song

Stop - you don’t wanna hear it
Always thinking you’re strong
Stop - girl you gotta hear it
You been singing that same sad song

Not sure how you think we’re having fun,
party’s all done and you’ve just begun.
Tryna clean up but you took the floor,
wanna sweep your mess right out the door.

Looking you up and down you’re close to boiling over
You’re losing your composure,

faded from overexposure, and you're

Reaching - you’re always making simple things a struggle
You know you’re making trouble
You’re anything but subtle

Thinking bout how I don’t ever need you
Thinking bout you daily
Thinking maybe you should come through

I been tryna shake it
But I know
There ain’t no mistakin’

Thought I could deny this craving,
caught me gazing, now I’m caving in
Thought that I could break it,
but I think you know
There ain’t no mistakin’

I been tryna kick you outta my head
Loving all the extra space in my bed
Falling into daydreams
Then I think about what you said


""Girl you got that high-life, double-time swing
and I’m like a low-key, summertime drink
Don’t know how to fight it
Tell me baby what do you think?”

I been tryna shake it
But I know
There ain’t no mistakin’

Thought I could deny this craving,
caught me gazing, now I’m caving in
Thought that I could break it
But I think you know
there ain’t no mistakin’

Tried so hard to get free,
breaking with the current, put
up my guard, couldn’t see
We were right in front of me

I can’t sleep, can’t you see?
Baby what you do to me
Tried so hard
Now I see

I been tryna shake it
But I know
There ain’t no mistakin’

Thought I could deny this craving,
caught me gazing, now I’m caving in
Thought that I could break it

In the dark, we
play with old mistakes

After midnight
You're asleep but
I stay wide awake

Make it stop, hold me close

Pick me up, put me down
Walk away, turn around
But it's still the same old thing

Toss and turn, then relax
Running from, running back
But it's still the same old thing

In your arms, yet again
Never want it to end
But it’s still the same
thing.

Call you up and
you come over
Every single time

See your headlights
Feel my heart rate
slowly start to climb

In my doorway
We don’t talk, there’s
nothing left to say

Grab your hair and
pull you close but
I am miles away

Take my hand, let it go
Make it stop, hold me close
But it's still the same old thing

Pick me up, put me down
Walk away, turn around

In a shop in Alley Way

In any window any day

To be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
To stay right where you are

In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners 
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me ev'rything I need 
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger

Oh it hurts so bad.
It started out so perfect, something god could only create.
I yearned enough for thinking you on this special day.???
Never once did i take for granted that you’ve been hurt before.
So you treated me like a lady and even more.
So i can’t understand why you brought storms into my life.
Tell me why, you destroyed every part of me.
Now what once a beautiful lady that you showered with your love must live with
A heart that bleeds.
This way again. that was the end. so please don’t take offense when i say
What i have to say.
Cause if you died i wouldn’t cry cause you never loved me any way.

Promises made and secrets told
Laying nights bent in ecstasy, we made love in a bed of roses for the universe
To see. there was no holding back from each other, both of our minds were
Free. we never wasted time apart, boy it seems like entirety.
So i can’t understand why you brought this pain into my life. oh tell me why.
I gave you a reason to live and you used my love in vain . so go on by
Yourself to survive this alone. you know you can’t come back home.
I hope you never come this way again. you did, you did. so please don’t take
Offense when i say what i have to say.
If you died i wouldn’t cry cause you never . no way.
No way no way
How could this be
After all the love you said we shared you turned around and leave.
Boy you know you were my heart and soul but i can’t be bad?? i gotta let
You go.
Together forever that’s what we both said. i didn’t know that life could be
So unfair.
Baby you did this to me.
You were my lover
So please don’t take offense when i say what i have to say.
I hope you die, i hope you die
Cause you never loved me anyway.
I... you never never never never never never never never
You use to be my best friend. you can get struck by lighting, washed away by
The sea, burned in a fire just don’t bring it back to me. cause
Cause you never loved me anyway."

Mmmmmmmmmmm
Oh it hurts so bad.
It started out so perfect, something god could only create.
I yearned enough for thinking you on this special day.???
Never once did i take for granted that you've been hurt before.
So you treated me like a lady and even more.
So i can't understand why you brought storms into my life.
Tell me why, you destroyed every part of me.
Now what once a beautiful lady that you showered with your love must live with
A heart that bleeds.
This way again. that was the end. so please don't take offense when i say
What i have to say.
Cause if you died i wouldn't cry cause you never loved me any way.

Promises made and secrets told
Laying nights bent in ecstasy, we made love in a bed of roses for the universe
To see. there was no holding back from each other, both of our minds were
Free. we never wasted time apart, boy it seems like entirety.
So i can't understand why you brought this pain into my life. oh tell me why.
I gave you a reason to live and you used my love in vain . so go on by
Yourself to survive this alone. you know you can't come back home.
I hope you never come this way again. you did, you did. so please don't take
Offense when i say what i have to say.
If you died i wouldn't cry cause you never . no way.
No way no way
How could this be
After all the love you said we shared you turned around and leave.
Boy you know you were my heart and soul but i can't be bad?? i gotta let
You go.
Together forever that's what we both said. i didn't know that life could be
So unfair.
Baby you did this to me.
You were my lover
So please don't take offense when i say what i have to say.
I hope you die, i hope you die
Cause you never loved me anyway.
I... you never never never never never never never never
You use to be my best friend. you can get struck by lighting, washed away by
The sea, burned in a fire just don't bring it back to me. cause
Cause you never loved me anyway."

She keeps Moet et Chandon 
In her pretty cabinet 
'Let them eat cake' she says 
Just like Marie Antoinette 
A built-in remedy 
For Kruschev and Kennedy 
At anytime an invitation 
You can't decline 

Caviar and cigarettes 
Well versed in etiquette 
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen 
Gunpowder, gelatine 
Dynamite with a laser beam 
Guaranteed to blow your mind

Insatiable an appetite 
Wanna try? 

To avoid complications 
She never kept the same address 
In conversation 
She spoke just like a baroness 
Met a man from China 
Went down to Asia Minor
Then again incidentally 
If you're that way inclined 

Perfume came naturally from Paris 
For cars she couldn't care less 
Fastidious and precise 
Chorus

Drop of a hat she's as willing as 
Playful as a pussy cat 
Then momentarily out of action 
Temporarily out of gas 
To absolutely drive you wild, wild 
She's all out to get you

Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Gotta leave you all behind

I will wait in the night until you decide to take me there
Cuz I know I don't stay here forever, it's time to be movin on

But you don't come back from the dead

And he was already starting to smell
Just to keep his hair still back
And the knife turned in his bell
Was he unforgiving, just tryina live it about
Never felt like this
Though I was walking where he's at???

I've let him down in a grave in the sand
And he gripped my arm with his dead man's head
He said I know I'm dead but I don't wanna die
In a grave out here where the carrions cry
I step out into the endless void
And I ain't going back if I got any choice
I know how to leave, I know how to die
I believe in no thrills in the afterlife

So leave me up out here my friend

Leave me wound here on through the sand

Baby it's all right we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going 'til the night turns into the day.

I had a visitor come from the great beyond.
Telling me our time in the world is done,
and to watch for a sign in the midnight sky.

What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby it's all right we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going 'til the night turns into the day.

What if the world dies with the sunrise?

What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going 'til the night turns into the day.

We wait for the sunrise.
We watch as the world dies.
We howl in the moonlight.
When the World Ender comes, baby don't close your eyes.
We wait for the sunrise.
We wait for the sunrise.

I had a vision tonight that the world was ending
Yeah the sky was falling and time was bending
We spent our last night in the moonlight
Baby it's so bright we'll be up all night.
I got a helluva view for the end of the world
I've got a bottle of booze and a beautiful girl.
If I'm a'­goin to die I'm gonna go in style.

What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby it's all right we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going 'til the night turns into the day.

1182,Rock,Lord Huron,Strange Trails ,Dead Man's Hand ,"Yellow lines in the dead of the night, I was heading back out west.
Trying to keep my eyes open wide, I'd gone days without any rest.
Saw him lying in the road looking bad about 20 yards ahead.
You come back from a trip to the east but you don't come back from the dead.

Sure as hell he was dead as they come and he was already starting to smell.
Just a kid with his hair slicked back and a knife tucked into his belt.
Was he unforgiven or just tired of living a life that never felt like his?
Though I was was worn and weary, I thought I'd bury him
and lay his soul to rest out in the desert night.

I laid him down in a grave in the sand
and he grabbed my arm with his dead man's hand.
He said: ""I know I'm dead but I don't wanna lie
in a grave out here where the coyote's cry.

I stared right into the endless void
and I ain't going back if I got any choice.
I know how to live, I don't know how to die
and there ain't no thrills in the afterlife.

So lift me up out of here my friend
and I'll wander the night 'til the ages end.""
Lit by the moon he walked through the sand
and he waved goodbye with his dead man's hand.

He will roam forever, haunting the desert.
He will roam forever, haunting the desert.

1183,Rock,Lord Huron,Strange Trails ,Hurricane (Johnnie's Theme) ,"I get a thrill outta playing with fire
Cause you hold your life when you hold that flame.
I get a kick outta thunder and lightning and
tearing through the night hollering your name

I get a laugh outta starin' at darkness
And wondering why people live in the light.
I drive fast and I rumble the hardest
I don't feel alive if I ain't in the fight.

I can't sleep when there's something to do
You spend your whole life dreaming and you wake up dead.
It's a long night can I spend it with you
Cause you're oh so pretty when you stand on the edge.

Oh little darlin' don't you look charming
Here in the eye of a hurricane.
Real or imagined - what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?

Oh little darlin' don't you like falling down
Through the sky like a diving plane.
Real or imagined - what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?

What is life? Only visions.
When I die, I'm coming right on back for you.
Who am I? An illusion.
Would I lie? I'm coming right on back for you.

Oh little darlin' don't you look charming
Here in the eye of a hurricane.
Real or imagined - what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?

1184,Rock,Lord Huron,Strange Trails ,La Belle Fleur Sauvage ,"What you're looking for won't be found easily
It grows upon the mountain in a sacred place
Up beyond the clouds, in ancient ground, so they say
And many men have died trekking up that away

Once he's gazed upon her, a man is forever changed
The bravest men return with darkened hearts and phantom pain
Ages come and go but her life goes on the same
She lives to see the sun and feel the wind and drink the rain

Her colors change to mark the passing of the days
No Earthly sight can match the beauty she displays
And when I die I want her lying by my side
In my grave, in my grave

I'd give it all to love that girl
I'll be the one to pluck that fleur

I'm meant to find the place where all good things begin
To smell her scent and watch her dancing in the wind
And when I die I want her lying by my side
In my grave, in my grave

I'd give it all to love that girl
I'll be the one to pluck that fleur
I'd give it all to love that girl
I'll be the one to pluck that fleur "

And I come back changed. I can feel it in my bones.
I fucked with forces that our eyes can't see.
Now the darkness got a hold on me.
Oh, the darkness got a hold on me.

How long, baby, have I been away?
Oh, it feels like ages though you say it's only days.
There ain't language for the things I've seen.
And the truth is stranger than my own worst dreams.
The truth is stranger than all my dreams.
Oh, the darkness got a hold on me.

I have seen what the darkness does.
Say goodbye to who I was.
I ain't never been away so long.

I speak to birds and tell them where to fly.
I sing the songs that you hear on the breeze.
I write the names of the rocks and the trees.

Oh you fool, there are rules, I am coming for you.
Darkness brings evil things, oh the reckoning begins.

I tried to warn you when you were a child.
I told you not to get lost in the wilds.
I sent you omens and all kinds of signs.
I taught you melodies, poems and rhymes.

Oh you fool, there are rules, I am coming for you.
You can run but you can't be saved.
Darkness brings evil things, oh the reckoning begins.

1187,Rock,Lord Huron,Strange Trails ,Cursed ,"What I remember the most is hollering her name
and the sirens wail as we ran like hell down a strange trail
Oh, I wanna know what I did, I wanna know her game.
I wanna learn her wits and how she plays her tricks, oh, I gotta know.

Lots of booze and her kiss
These are drugs that do not mix.
I was under her spell
and today I feel like hell.
She got me going, I guess.
Who knew love would be like this?
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I guess I gotta see it through.

Cause I don't know how to walk out of this deal.
The spell she cast on me is real.
I don't know how to right the wrongs I've done.
She bends the wills of men for fun.
I don't know how to take my own life back.
Everything she touches turns to black.
I don't know how to fight what I can't see.
That girl has laid a curse on me.

I gotta find me a cure.
I gotta clear my name.
There's gotta be some way
I hope it's not too late
To break the spell.

Yeah,
I want to get her alone.
I want to ask her why.
And look into those eyes
and see the endless night
staring back.

What kind of magic is this?
I was doomed by our first kiss.
Just a pawn in her game
I've done things that have no name.
And she'll make me do worse
If the law doesn't get me first
She has cloaked me in black
And there ain't no turning back.

There are runes on my skin.
They appear when she walks in.
I am bound by her spell.
I am chained to do her will.
I'm a goner, I guess.
Who knew love was gonna be like this?
She has cloaked me in black.
And there ain't no turning back.

Cause I don't know how to walk out of this deal.
The spell she cast on me is real.
I don't know how to right the wrongs I've done.
She bends the wills of men for fun.

I've been running through life and cruising toward death
If you think that I'm scared you've got me wrong
If you don't know my name, you'll know it now
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those that came first
There are many more flames when mine is gone
They will build me no shrines and sing me no songs

I'm a long way from the one that I loved
I've been tending old flames, lamenting what was
Drifting in a land time forgot
If you think that I've changed, you know me not
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those that came first
I been unraveling since my birth
Gonna wander out there and see what I'm worth

Find me way out there
there's no road that will lead us back
When you follow the strange trails
they will take you who knows where
If I found a way to stay with you tonight
it would only make me late, for a date I can't escape

Don't wanna die I wanna wander the world with you

Do you know what loneliness does to a man?
Turn him into the walking dead
I may have died but your lovin' raised me.

So tell me that I won't ever be lonely again
You saved my life I just wanna repay you in kind

To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmation
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now
All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out
More blessings for Sandy and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups
On this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious

And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a ""not guilty""
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid
That never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, ""This what we need to be on,"" but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is
Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is
Numbers inflated
They all look at me like, ""What have you done for me lately?""
""I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest.""
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases

You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis

Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep (Mmmm!)
Taller in person, you'll see when we meet
I heard your new shit and I'm kissin' my teeth
(Jheeze)

Bringin' that dirty, dirty, bringin' that certy
Nizzy with the quick extension, ringin' off thirty
I've got bitches and they're murky, swervin', lookin' all curvy
And you already know I love them breasts, lookin' all perky
Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Spend jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky
Whippin' that white girl, cookin' that Cersei
I'm just pushin' that dark shit, pushin' that charcoal
Now this is that big bad, this is Gustavo
Look at them jokers, look at that arsehole
Man are gettin' bread now, this is that hard dough
Clap man, dominant murder
I'm a black man, government earner
Could've just slapped man, but he wanted it further
Batman, da-na-na-da-na

1208,R&B,Drake,More LIfe ,Lose You ,"I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

No snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?"
1209,R&B,Drake,More LIfe ,Can't Have Everything ,"Yeah, uh, man, fresh up out the sand
February 10, it's the boy, but I'm still the man
Come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands
Then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the row
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17

Want a lot, can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything

Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down
Who's callin' my name? Who's involved now?
Tell me who I gotta down, I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn

Can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything

Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein', 'cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin' always duckin' my release date
That's when the phone starts ringin', like, “Are we straight?“
Two-faced nigga back around with the three face
Damn, oh, triple double, Russ face
Watch with the bust face
Never met the plug, but I rap about the plug face
Never met my self, I don't remember who I was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think you niggas teamin' up and scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
Six side, east side, all that for my area

You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high."

You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-i-ive
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-i-ize
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y

It's all love when I ride top down
Top down (I started out way down low)
Started from the bottom, now we here now
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
We about to get the whole nine
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I just take the dreams I've been sold
And sell 'em for more, you already know
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

Hope I deal with karma 'fore my son do
'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof
Man, the glow got me feelin' like I'm gunproof

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I still have my guard up
Blame this thing I'm part of
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin' the time to clear my mind

Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

I know and I miss you
Know how to treat you, but it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news, like ""dun-dun-dun-dun""
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

Couldn't tell you were special

You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a little sexual, with you
Because I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wavecap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend

We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly

Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, baby
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something

Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with Ian Throw
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on a rotary phone
I take a glass, it don't mean, ""Nah, don't go with me home.""
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry youth when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can’t describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me, and frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is set around competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary

I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that's takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That's not respectable all of a sudden?
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

They're nothing anyway.
They're no better than me.
Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you.
Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals.
You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

No snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in

Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with

It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'mma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause

[Chorus]
You know me, you know me
You know me, you know me
Every time we try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

[Bridge]
Why don't you shake something, shake something
For the Don, don't you break nothing, break nothing
Big girl won't you work something, work something
For the Don, don't you hurt nothing, hurt nothing
Big girl won't you shake something, shake something
For the Don, don't you break nothing, break nothing
Baby girl won't you work something, work something
For the Don, don't you hurt nothing, hurt nothing

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

How to segue
Pussy, power, profit in headache
I reminisce my life innocence
Or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint
With light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us are probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (head)
Head, head, more head (head)
Oh God, bless the dead (yah)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna cop more land
I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

Who I am, Who I am, Who I am
Do I really need an intro
Dey know, dey know, dey know
Do I really need an intro
Who I am, Who I am, Who I am

All I get is respect, as soon as I eject the vehicle
I bet you cannot detect, the scratch of a defect
From where the streets feast at, but made it out the belly of the beast without a C-sect
I'm so straight up, I'm so erect
Hype off that action, I'm so direct
I know it's a hundred thousand niggas up in Michigan
Doing it, but where I lack in talent I make up for it in discipline
And go hard, so hard til nobody else is on my sonar, radar, or lane cause I Bogart
Nowadays all we do is classic, Mozart
Outta here, it would be polite to send a postcard

I meant a post heart, yall niggas post hard
So lost co-star, coast off au revoir
I mean look at all we been in
And I look up in the mirror like boy you aint even finished

(Chorus)

Do they really need my info, to show them what they in for
I'm recognized like kinfolk, even when my brim low
I come from where that life talk, where dat where dat knife talk

and on them nights how we grind til its light out
grind til the sunset, til my grandson set, yup

Uh-huh, is it time?

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look, I spent my whole life trying to improvise
I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize
Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with
You know, take the fame, take the crib
Take our cars, now we gotta take the train
Hood niggas takin' chains, slave master take our names
5-0 take the shot, and young souls take the blame
Man but they can't take away the light

[Hook: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light, hell nah the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Got the whole city on fire
Boy, this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired
This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire
This the flow that got my whole family finna retire
Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch
Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch
My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town
Where if they know you brown, they might hold you down
And even hose you down, man
Since I'm a son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon
So when they take the fame, take the crib
Take our cars, now we gotta take the train
Hood niggas takin' chains, slave master take our names
5-0 take the shot and young souls take the blame
Man, but they can't take away the light

No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light, hell nah the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me cause I’m homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be s-shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though (Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga fuck what you know
Nigga I’m takin' back control
The under dog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it

'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (Brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, ""Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too.""
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America; I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30, so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout
But they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins
Though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means, so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing, dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power—how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the GOAT while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods

[Verse 2: Eminem]
If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes, like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, ""late"" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back, like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round, like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle, rubber
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
A banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it, Trump's a bitch
I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A.
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beatin ‘em, bet you they'll lay bleeding
And yell, ""Wait!"" pleading—but screaming is pointless
Like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving them pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma…

1404,R&B,Big Sean,I Decided. ,Voices in My Head ,"Part 1: ""Voices in My Head""

[Hook]
Voices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
(You know better, what the fuck!)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(You always do the same shit)

[Verse]
This was supposed to be the last time, last hit
Last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn
This was supposed to be the last one, last two
Last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me about
(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit

[Hook]
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)
Voices in my head saying that I knew better
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still, fuck
(That's your problem, you don't listen!)

Part 2: ""Stick to the Plan""

[Bridge]
Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like
Look (Metro Boomin want some more, nigga!)

[Hook]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 1]
Stay focused
Don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else you notice
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking fronting and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah, tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracting
Put that into what's worth having (boy)

[Hook]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 2]
Stay focused
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)

[Verse 3]
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head"

Thank you God for all my set backs
'Cause he the reason I'm able to get back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack, yeah

[Verse: Big Sean]
This the feeling know that I've been missing some days
This feel like I'm headed to paradise one way
This feel like the family dinners that we used to have on Sunday
With Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake
Or this spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man
This feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam
Pink Timb's, in the Lamb
Mixing it in with Dilla and
Headphones to the ceiling fan
Bucket hat like Gilligan, yeah
Lately I've been talking to ghosts
Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most
You know I still rep you when you're gone though
I got a picture of us on the front lawn
With me, grandma and mom, that night I went off to prom
Wishin' you could see the lights all dijon and parmesan
Funny thing about it is you always act like you knew
You told me how you were feeling before it happened, before it do
And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through
And you and grandma went broke so we would never get bruised
You the reason that I ever touched my first Franklin
Fast forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin
It reminded me of how we always used to dress up as a family
And go to Sunday service, and being in church, singin'
Ain't been to church in awhile
But it ain't just about how you just praise him in the building
It's about how you praisin' him while you out
You taught me to remember that when I get set back
Been through the worst times to get the best back
Wishin' for a time machine to jet back
To my all time low self and throw me a jetpack, woah
And see you again, needless to say
Back when I dated Alisha, Simone
Or any other girl who looked like Lisa Bonet
Who was jealous of me and Jhené
Who you would always advise with me being away
You was right, but I had to learn for myself
I guess a time came for me to earn for myself
I hope that this is somewhat of a thank you for all your help
Hope the angels take care of you until I see you myself

[Bridge: The-Dream]
Praise, so many times I prayed for you
I put up prayers for you
Praise, for all the times that you prayed for me
All the nights you stayed by me
All the nights that you cried and all the days I coulda died
Because of you I survived, because of you I'm still alive

Thank you God for all my set backs
'Cause he the reason I'm able to get back

Introduced me to The Temptations
Marvin Gaye and Isley Brothers
Dancing so hard the living room shaking
Yeah we dance in the house
My mama's the man of the house
Mama you too good for them men
Even dad, you too good for him

You deserve early retirement
You text me, tell me to take my vitamins
When I got a new love you invite 'em in
When we break up, you don't like 'em then (no)
Loyal, loyal, swear you super loyal
Worth more to me than striking oil
You deserve the life I'm tryna show ya
I remember all of the sacrifices
Growing up in debt, but never hungry
Rich in everything except money
That's that faith that you can't buy

I buy that new car in the color that you like it in

You wonder when I'ma come around
I know you worry about me
I give you attitude like, ""Don't worry 'bout it""
Don't hit ya up like I don't care about you
But I hold you down, I swear I got you
I know I got problems communicating
I probably should've went to school
And got that degree in communications
I should be with you on vacation
I should take you where you should be taken
Asia, Africa, Dubai, anything you want, I do buy
Just want you to know I do try
To take care of ya, mama you the one, you the one
You the moon, you the stars, you the sun
I'm so happy I'm your son
I'm so happy I'm your son
You love me since day one
Since before day one
So before the day's done
I gotta, gotta let you know

If I ever made you not feel like it, then this is my apology
So sorry, look, dear mama you know your son shine for ya

But I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically
'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually
So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'ma text the room number right now
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
Don't ask for me, don't ask for me
Don't ask for me
Lot of shit been goin' on, things goin' wrong
So don't ask for me

[Hook]
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

[Verse 2]
She been mad, I've been on the go, on a roll
On a roll more than a roller coaster
They can't throw me off track or slow
If I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes
I quote unquote say I told you so
Heaven on earth, every night is paradise
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that
I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s
Still smokin' that 520 like it's 420
On a quest for more money, more hungry
Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'
Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'
Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'
In my city I'm Warren Buffett, I mean business, the shirt is tucked in
The gun's tucked in, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with
Who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with
My stock's risin', I'm goin' public
If I write it, it's gon' publish
You're fuckin' with the best, no discussion

So disgusting
It's that 3 and a third shit
Straight up

I think I’m ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I’m ready to jump out the window

[Verse 1]
Straight up, straight up, look
Know ya momma didn’t raise you to take no disrespect, yeah
I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check, yeah
You cried on my phone the whole night
That time he crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh I was there) I went to straighten his ass out
And you told me never mind yeah, yeah, yeah
The question isn't, ""Do he love ya?"" The question is, ""Do ya love yourself?""
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess way back then
We the best thing that never happened, but

[Verse 2]
You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation? What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation, you need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look
Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo' hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needin' clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me

I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)

It's gon' take more than that to set it right, though
'Cause you so fucking outta line
For ever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

[Verse 1]
Feel like you owe me checks
Owe me time, owe me sex
Long nights, no reply
I got no regrets, you disrespect, disrespect
Only time I seen you now is on the internet
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to
You got my tattoo, we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals
Now you back, it's our revival
They don't make you feel like I do
They didn't make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku
Seems like all you got is hate for me
All you ever did was take from me
'Cause you know you got that walk from me
How you dress and how you talk from me
Let's not ever disrespect what I meant to ya
It took us being over to see all I did for ya
Damn

I'm just trying to let the past pass
Ain't no future in that, yeah
I stay 100 like my dash, yeah
Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah
Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask
Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass
Honestly I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play no blame game
Pointing fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust
I don't wanna have a fake us

Getting hurt every time I'm close to you
I think me and you are overdue
I think this is what we supposed to do

And money turned me into a workaholic
And money turned her into a twerkaholic
Yeah do it, do it, do it with no hands
Do it like you do it when you do it with your man
I could pull up in a Honda Civic, pulling bitches
Ain't about the cars, bout that nigga who is in it

Start it up, guaranteed I'mma finish
In the nighttime, I feel like the right time

And when you feel something you can't see
But you know it's meant to be
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me yeah
Bigger than me, bigger than me
When the whole family depend on you to eat
And at night you can't sleep
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Get it, get it, get it
I pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha
I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture
Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister
I see myself in the young ones
When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror
Corleone all on my own (Don)
Cartier all on my arm
All I hear is sirens and car alarms
Niggas going to war with no armor on
First time I seen a dead body I was 14
And I felt the pressure
Like if I don't get it, I might end up next to him
I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7
Seven, seven, seven, 7-11 it's 911 getting called around
The hood America's lost and found
Where niggas get lost and never found
All I ever wanted was to turn these Gs into Ms and a Mercedes key
Got it and still felt incomplete
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Hook: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]

When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
You gon' realize that this was bigger than me

[Post-Hook: Starrah]
Used to want that foreign
Got that foreign, now it's boring
Started touring
Swear to God that's when I realized this shit was bigger than me
Flex on niggas with a Rollie
Got that Rollie with the shine
But lost my time
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

I seen people in the same place 10 years later
Man that shit pathetic
God talking to me telepathic like it only happen if you let it
I can't spend my whole life looking at the same ceiling fan
When I feel like I ain't got no ceilings man
If I ain't special why I feel it then?
I gotta get on the road
I gotta be the one chose
I gotta come back and tell the greatest story they never told
This must be the feeling that you get when you know you close
And you know it's a way in even when the doors are closed
And realize this shit is bigger than me yeah

[Big Sean:] Yeah yeah, I'm listening. I love you too
[Myra Anderson:] In a way I feel like I'm living through you. Sometimes it feels like I got another chance at everything
[Big Sean:] Man that's deep to feel like that. I kinda feel the same way though sometimes
[Myra Anderson:] Yeah
[Big Sean:] With all the work that's goin' on I feel like this is like my second time doin' it so I know that sound crazy but, you know I just I don't know why I always imagine myself as like someone who failed at everything he ever did at life you know and I got to the end of life and just regretted it all and somehow, this is my chance to go back and get it all right. And when I wake up, with that mindset, you know, it completely changes my hunger, how I approach the whole day. I mean you decide to live your life like that then pshh man I guarantee we'll live life to our best potential

You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl
Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real

Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you

[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

It's like “for real, are you dumb?”

Look
Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one

Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it

Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it

I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'

Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing to never lose me
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the ""are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin' make sure you tell me

What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

Remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow, Ohhh, ohhh!
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves

You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit"

I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Hook]
I try with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

[Post-Hook]
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

[Hook]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do

[Intro: Baka]
Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Hook: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Hook: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done"

[Verse]
One of dem ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back to where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t how it always seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right
Yeah"
1421,R&B,Drake,Views ,Redemption ," Produced By Noah “40” Shebib


[Intro]
Yeah, I get it
I get it
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now, yeah

[Verse 3]
Say to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' was for me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

You hit me like “I know you’re there with someone else""
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text
I want to get straight to the climax
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back
Cause you talk like you got what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze
Talk like you bet it all on me

Don't make me give you back

[Hook: Drake]
I say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you I already know
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit

Yeah, rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
She rode it like a, yeah, yeah
I got it, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
You don't wanna fall in love I know
I'm not someone you should trust I know
I give Chanel out like a hug I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac, like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...

[Refrain 2: Ha-Sizzle]
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
Rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier

[Intro: Drake]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 3: Drake]
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

[Chorus: Drake & Rihanna]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

They throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna wife
Fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back
And never on the side, yeah

You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you'll never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside

You a real ass woman and I like it

I need you inspired, I need you excited

I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say ""a guarantee""
I mean you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em

[Intro: The Winans]
Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buying fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana trying not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
""It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait""
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm getting straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards them goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think running this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talking in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Running through the 6, thumbing through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got something left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either

Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone

Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

[Outro]
Anytime people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it

Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times
I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in
I talk myself out
I get all worked up
Then I let myself down

I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I thought of every possibility

And I know someday that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait
I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing
And the other half's luck
Wherever you are
Whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere
And into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

And somehow I know that it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

They say all's fair in love and war
But I won't need to fight it
We'll get right
And we'll be united

And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility

And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you kid I'll give more than I get
Than I get

Oh you know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out

When sky's are gray, when sky's are blue
Morning, noon and nighttime, too
All I do the whole day through is dream of you
When sky's are gray, even when they're blue

Now some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to turn back now
There's too much going on

Now this night is gonna last forever
And last, and last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know, oh
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know, oh, let's go, babe

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon's shining bright
So turn out the light and we'll get it right
There'll be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know

Somebody's gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothing we can do

Now everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Now everybody wants to take a chance
And make it come out right, right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know, oh, let's go, babe

Well, we can beat around the bushes
We can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parking lot
But, but either way

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know"

I would do at this moment,
When you're standing before me,
With tears in your eyes
Tryin to tell me that you
Found you another
And you just don't love me no more

And what did you think,
I would say at this moment,
When I'm faced with the knowledge,
That you just don't love me ?
Did you think I would curse you,
Or say things to hurt you,
Cause you just don't love me no more..

Did you think I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you
Oh come on you know me too well!
How could I hurt you
When darling I love you
And you know, I would never hurt you..

What do you think
I would give at this moment
If you just stay I'd subtract twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees,
I kiss the ground that you walk on
If I could just hold you again

I'd fall down on my knees
Kiss the ground that you walk on baby
If I could just hold you
If I could just hold you
I would fall down, down on my knees
Oh God, please
Let me hold you, let me hold you
Again...

1513,Hip-Hop,Michael Buble,Crazy Love ,Stardust ,"Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
Oh but that was long ago
And now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

And beside a garden wall
When the stars were bright
You were in my arms
The nightingale tells its fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew

Though I dream in vain
In my heart it always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

Though I dream in vain
In my heart it always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain"
1514,Hip-Hop,Michael Buble,Crazy Love ,Whatever It Takes ,"We've all been hurt by love, it's out of our hands*
For all it's worth I'm drawing a line that's in the sand.
Another morning just won't do.
I need your love to shine on through
Or it won't be new.

Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it,
Whatever it takes, my love.
To put the lonely days behind us, I'm laying it down,
Whatever it takes my love.

If there's a chance for two hearts to celebrate,
To blow out some candles and tempt the hands of fate,
You make a wish, I'll make one, too. (I'll make a wish)
But close your eyes, love, when you do
Or it won't be true.

Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it.
Whatever it takes, my love,
To put the lonely days behind us, I'm laying it down,
Whatever it takes, my love.

Because I've been wandering around with the same old blues
That have been dragging me down if you feel the same way, too.
Maybe it just takes two.

And, if we give thanks for our love at each new dawn,
We'll find the strength and the will to carry on.
The sun alone will never do (Ooohhh)
Without your love to shine on through.
It just won't be new.

Whatever it takes, 
Oh, whatever it takes, my love, 
To put the lonely days behind us, I'm laying it down, 
Whatever it takes, my love, 
Ohhh, whatever it takes, my love, 
Ohhh, to put the lonely days behind us, laying it down.

Whatever it takes, my love, my love, my love.
Whatever it takes, 
Whatever it takes, my love, 
To put the lonely days behind us, I'm laying it down, 
Whatever it takes, my love. (Whatever it takes, my love.)"

Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven

You took my love and now you're gone

I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

It's too bad, it's so sad, I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you

Not if my love can't bind your heart

There is no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning
Just touch my cheek before you leave me baby
Just call me angel of the morning
Slowly slowly turn away from me

Well maybe the sun's light will be dim
But it don't matter anyhow
If morning echo says we've sinned
Then it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I promise you I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel
Touch my cheek before you leave me baby
Just call me angel of the morning morning
Just touch my cheek before you leave me baby

Just touch my cheek before you leave me baby
Just call me angel of the morning

When they sit all 'round all day
This old woman I, I knew
I used to go over there and sit with her
And she'd be sitting around
In a rocking chair talking to herself

And she used to say she used to say
""Sometimes the cold gets in my bones so bad
Till I just don't think I can go on
Yeah and for a little while well I don't care
If my days are coming to an end
And just as soon be gone sometimes""

Sometimes the night comes down on me
And I know what's ahead
An evening in this cold old house
With no one to say goodnight to me when I go to bed
An evening in this cold old house
With no one to say goodnight to me when I go to bed

Sometimes, I wonder why I stay
What am I waiting for?
My children are grown and gone away
They got children of their own now
Don't need me anymore

In winter when the streets are bare
There ain't nothing much to see
I just can't help missing and thinking
About that kindly man
That one old winter time came
And took away from me

And then one morning
Another spring is there outside my door
Things are blooming
Birds are singing
And suddenly yes well I ain't sad
Ain't sad no more, ain't sad no more

When it's warm and the sun is out
It's like my heart's restored
I've had my love, I've had my children
And I have so many memories
So don't mind me complaining
What the years may bring

'Cos this whole world has been fine with me really
And I'm thankful for seeing another spring
It's gonna be better this time, another spring
It's gonna be groovier this time, another spring
It's what's happening this time
So I'm thankful for letting me see another spring"

Another way for today

You want me to see you
Baby, I cannot see you
You want me to come for you

I cannot come for you
'Cos you want an assignment
I see no concession

Shall I hang my head with yours and be blue
Send away laughter and fun
Spend all my time thinking about you
Don't you know there are things I can't do for you

My mind is on its way
Another way for today
My spirit is so foreign
You want silence

My spirit is taking flight now
But, baby, you're in a mood
And you wanna cry tonight now

Shall I hang my head with yours and be blue

He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin fallin' down

You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don't know how to smile

Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If there's anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares?

You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell yuh
That you ain't a-got no friend

Your babies are crying louder
It's pounding on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
It's pounding on your brain
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you
Like the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass it is turning black
There's no water in your well
Your grass is turning black
There's no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's pounding roar

There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people born"

Beautiful Land



  Anthony Newley, Leslie Bricusse 

  Red is the color of a lot of lollipops,
Orange is any orange on a tree.
Yellow's the color of a bag of lemon drops,
Green is a piece of seaweed in the sea.

Blue is the color of the sky in summertime
Indigo is a Siamese cat's eyes.
Violet's the color of a flow'r in wintertime.
These are the colors of the rainbow skies.

There is a beautiful land
Where all your dreams come true;
It's all tied up in a rainbow,
All shiny and new;
But it's not easy to find
No matter what you do.

It's not on top of a mountain
Or beneath the deep blue sea
Or in London zoo or in Timbuktoo,
Or in Timbuckthree.

And if you travelled the world
From China to Peru,
There's no beautiful land on the chart.
An explorer could not begin
To discover its origin
For the beautiful land is in your heart."

With a heartbreak ahead for your goal,
Here I go - Now you know why I'm leaving.

And back ever since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women sheding tear
Over a brown eyed handsome man
It's a lot of trouble with a brown eyed handsome man

Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter, darling go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
Just like your daddy, he is a brown eyed handsome man

Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To meet a brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

Two, three the count with nobody on

That I want you just like a thousand other girls

Desperate Ones



  Jacques Brel, Jouannest, Eric Blau, Mort Shuman 

  They hold each others hands
They walk without a sound
Down forgotten streets
Their shadows kiss the ground
Their footsteps
sing a song
Tat's ended before it's begun
They walk without a sound
The desperate ones

Just like the tiptoe moth
That dance before the flame
They burn their hearts so much
That death is just a name
And if love calls again
So foolishly they run, they run, they run
They run, they run, they run, they run
They run without a sound
The desperate ones

I know the road tey're on
I've walked their crooked mile
A hundred times or more
I drank their cup of bile
They watch their dreams go down
Be hind the settin sun
Yeh, yeh, yeh, they walk without a sound
The desperate ones

Le he who threw the stone at them
Stand up and take a bow
He knows the verb ""to love""
Beu he'll never, never, never know how
On the bridge of nevermore
They disappear one by one
Disappear without a sound
The desperate ones

And underneath the bridge
The water's sweet and deep
This is their journey's end
The land of endless sleep
They cry to us for help
We think it's all in fun,
They cry, they cry, they cry, they cry
Without a sound
They disappear without a sound
They walk without a sound without a sound
Disappear without a sound
Cry without a sound

It's mighty sweet, forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat, forbidden fruit
Go ahead and taste it, you don't wanna waste it""

Except that apple that leads to sinning, so let that apple be
But Eve got tempted so she tried it and as all chicks do
Teased her man till he decided, he'd just try some too

Go on and eat, forbidden fruit

It's quite a treat, forbidden fruit
Go ahead and bite it, I bet you'd be delighted

I hate to tell you all what followed, the Lord was most upset
Saw them making love and hollered, ""What have you to add?""
And when they made a full confession, the Lord says ""Hmm I see
I guess, I'll have to teach you a lesson about not minding me""

""Go on and eat, forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet, forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat, forbidden fruit
You're all indebted, now you gonna get it""

The Lord made Eve be Adam's madam, have his kids and all
Placed some labor laws on Adam and he made the snake to fall
Ever since the days of Eden folks been sinful my
Nowadays they're even eating apples in their pie

Go on and eat, forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat, forbidden fruit

Take warnin' from me

And shove you into bed
And if they steal your nuclear secret
She'll wish you were dead

Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay

Oh mother, dear mother
No, I'm not afraid
For I'll go on that march
And I'll return a virgin maid

With a brick in my handbag
And a smile on my face
And barbed wire in my underwear
To shed off disgrace

Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay
Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay

One day they were marching
A young man came by
With a beard on his chin
And a gleam in his eye

And before she had time
To remember her brick

And before she had time
To remember her brick
They were holding a sit-down
On a neighboring hay rig

Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay
Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay

For meeting is pleasure
And parting is pain
And if I have a great concert
Maybe I won't have to sing those folk songs again

Oh mother, dear mother
I'm stiff and I'm sore
From sleeping three nights
On a hard classroom floor

Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay
Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay

One day at the briefing
She'd heard a man say
Go perfectly limp
And be carried away

So when this young man suggested
It was time she was kissed
She remembered her brief
And then did not resist

Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay

Oh mother, dear mother
No need for distress
For the young man has left me
His name and address

And if we win
Though a baby there be
He won't have to march
Like his da-da and me"

Miss the prayer meetings where people pray

Or maybe except when I hear your name
Someone's laugh that's just the same
I've forgotten you just like
I should

What a guy
What a fool am I
To think my aching hearth
Could keep the moon
What's in store
Should I phone once more
No, no, no, no, no
It's best that I stick to my tune

Ever think of spring

Surely break my heart in two"

Il N'y A Pas d'Amour Hereaux



Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Rien n'est jamais acquis à l'homme. Ni sa force
Ni sa faiblesse ni son cœur. Et quand il croit
Ouvrir ses bras son ombre est celle d'une croix
Et quand il croit serrer son bonheur il le broie
Sa vie est un étrange et douloureux divorce

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Sa vie elle ressemble à ces soldats sans armes
Qu'on avait habillés pour un autre destin
A quoi peut leur servir de ce lever matin
Eux qu'on retrouve au soir désarmés incertains
Dites ces mots ma vie et retenez vos larmes

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Mon bel amour mon cher amour ma déchirure
Je te porte dans moi comme un oiseau blessé
Et ceux-là sans savoir nous regardent passer
Répétant après moi les mots que j'ai tressés
Et qui pour tes grands yeux tout aussit&ocirc;t moururent

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Le temps d'apprendre à vivre il est déjà trop tard
Que pleurent dans la nuit nos cœurs à l'unisson
Ce qu'il faut de malheur pour la moindre chanson
Ce qu'il faut de regrets pour payer un frisson
Ce qu'il faut de sanglots pour un air de guitare

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Il n'y a pas d'amour qui ne soit à douleur
Il n'y a pas d'amour dont on ne soit meurtri
Il n'y a pas d'amour dont on ne soit flétri
Et pas plus que de toi l'amour de la patrie
Il n'y a pas d'amour qui ne vive de pleurs

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux
Mais c'est notre amour à tous deux"

When he presses his fingertips upon my lips
And he begs me to please keep still
In the dark

But soon, this dance will be endin'
And you're gonna be missed
Gee, I'm not pretendin',
'Cause I swear it's fun, fun to be kissed

We used to sit around the fire place, till the cornbread, it was done
And then, we all would eat our supper, after that, we'd clean the kitchen
It's the only time they ever gave us to spare to have a little fun

Then, my daddy used to take his fiddle down that hung upon the wall
While the silvery moon was shining clear and bright
How the old folks would enjoy it, they would sit all night and listen
As we used to sing in the evenin' by the moonlight

In the evenin' by the moonlight, you could hear banjos ringin'
You could hear them by the moonlight, you could hear my folks all singing
How my mother she would enjoy it, she would sit all night and listen

In the daytime I will meet you as before
You will find me waiting by the ocean floor
Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world nobody understands
In the morning it's the morning of my life

In the morning of my life
Minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day

In the evening I will fly you to the moon
To the top right hand corner of the ceiling in my room
And there we will stay till the sun shines
Another day toplay on clothesline
May I be yawning

But I'm gonna tell you soon
It's a pity

Isn't it a pity
Isn't it a shame
Yes, how we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain

How we take each other's love
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back, forgetting to remember
Just forgetting a note of thank you
Isn't it a pity

Some things take so long
But how do I explain
Why not too many people can see that we are all just the same
We're all guilty

Because all the tears
Our eyes just can't hope to see
But I don't think it's applicable to me
The beauty that surrounds them
Child, isn't it a pity

How we take each other's love
The most precious thing without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back, forgetting to keep open the door

But I understand some things take so long
But how do I explain
Why not too many people can see, we're just the same

And because of all their tears
Their eyes can't hope to see
The beauty that surrounds them
God, isn't it a pity

The beauty that surrounds them
It's a pity
The beauty that surrounds them
It's a pity

The beauty that surrounds us
And we don't see it
We think things are just the same
We've been programmed that way
Isn't it a pity

If you want to feel sorry
Isn't it a pity, isn't it a pity
The beauty sets the beauty that surrounds us
Because of all our tears
Our eyes can't hope to see

Maybe one day at least I'll see me
And just concentrate on givin', givin', givin', givin'
And till that day mankind don't stand a chance
Don't know nothin' about romance, everything is plastic
Isn't it a pity

I want a lot of other things, I've never had before

Pretending that I am so wonderful and knowing, I'm adored

I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I'm as starry eyed and gravely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never never heard
From a man, I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud
Or a Robin or a bluebird on the wing

But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring
It might as well be, might as well be
It might as well be spring"

It was raining from the first
Everybody knows I was dying of thirst
So I came here and a long time's curse
And what's worse is this pain in here
I can't stay in here, ain't it clear, ain't it clear

I must admit, I believe it's time for us to quit
And when we meet again, bein' introduced as friends

Just to have my love return

It smolders in flames

When the fire is burning out
And the angels call my name
Dying love will leave no doubt

Oh, she was a lass from the low country
And he was a lord of high degree
But she loved her lordship so tenderly. Oh sorrow sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod
And no one knows she loved him but herself and God

One morn when the sun was on the mead
He passed by her door on a milk white steed
She smiled and she spoke, but he paid no heed
Oh sorrow sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod
And no one knows she loved him but herself and God

If you be a lass from the low country
Don't love no lord of high degree
They haint got a heart for sympathy
Oh sorrow sing sorrow

And no one knows she loved him but herself and God"

Last Rose of Summer



  Thomas Moore, Nina Simone 

  'Tis the last rose of summer, left blooming all alone
All her lovely companions are faded and gone.
No flower of her kindred, no rose bud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh.

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one! to pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
'Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead.

So soon may I follow, when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away
When true hearts lie wither'd and fond ones are flown
Oh! who would inhabit this bleak world alone!"

It's not 'cause I wouldn't,
It's not 'cause I shouldn't,
And, you know though well, it's not 'cause I couldn't,
It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town.

My poor heart is achin'
To bring home the bacon,
And if I find myself alone and forsaken,
It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town.

Though I'm more than willing to learn
How these gals get so much extra money to burn,
Every proposition I just turn it down,
'Way down,

It's not 'cause I shouldn't, honey,

It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town."

Let It Be Me

  I bless the day I found you,
I want to stay around you
and so I beg you, let it be me.

Don't take this heaven from one,
if you must cling to someone
now and forever, let it be me.

Each time we meet, love,
I find complete love.
Without your sweet love
what would life be?

So never leave me lonely,
tell me you'll love me only
and that you'll always let it be me.

If for each bit of gladness
someone must taste of sadness
I'll bear the sorrow, let it be me.

No matter what the price is
I'll make no sacrifices.
Through each tomorrow let it be me.

To you I'm praying,
hear what I'm saying.
Please, let your heart beat
for me, just me.

And never leave me lonely,
tell me you'll love me only
and that you'll always let it be me,
let it be me.

Comme l'argile

L'esclave docile
Je t'appartiens

De tout mon???tre
Tu es le seul ma”tre
Je dois me soumettre
Je t'appartiens

Si tu condamnes
Jetant mon ‰me
Au creux des flammes
Je n'y peux rien1

Avec les peines
L'amour et la haine
Coulant dans mes veines
Je t'appartiens

Que puis-je faire
Pour te satisfaire
Patron de la terre
Sur mon chemin

Comme les anges
Chanter tes louanges
Mais je ne suis pas un ange
Tu le sais bien

Je ne suis qu'un homme
Rien qu'un pauvre homme
Je t'aime comme
Comme un copain

Souvent je pense
Que dans ton immense
Palais de silence
Tu dois???tre bien"

Lilac Wine



  James Shelton 

  I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see...
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because I brings me back you...

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?

Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

Lilac Wine, I feel unready for my love..."

'Cause your hopes are getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
To cheer little girl blue"

how long I have waited
waited just to love you, now that I have found you
don't ever go

You've got the
Look of love, it's on your face
a look that time can't erase
be mine tonight
let this be just the start of so many nights like this
let's take a lover's vow and then seal it with a kiss

I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you

waited just to love you, now that I have found you

Oh we used to go a courting along October hills
And he could laugh away the dark clouds, cry away the snow

For there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be
When I get that mood indigo
I could lay me down and die

You ain't been blue, no, no, no child
You ain't never been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo
That feeling goes stealing right down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, go along blues"

More I See You, The



  (1945) Mack Gordon, Harry Warren 

  The more I see you,
The more I want you.
Somehow this feeling
Just grows and grows.
With every sigh I become more mad about you,
More lost without you,
And so it goes.
Can you imagine
How much I'll love you
The more I see you
As years go by?
I know the only one for me can only be you.
My arms won't free you;
My heart won't try."

Mr. Bojangles



I knew a man Bojangles
And he danced for you
In worn out shoes
With silver hair, a ragged shirt
And baggy pants, the old soft shoe
He jumped so high, he jumped so high
Then he lightly touched down

I met him in a cell in New Orleans
I was down and out
He looked at me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg a step

He said his name, Bojangles
And he danced a lick across the cell
He grabbed his pants
in fettered stance
Oh, he jumped up high
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!

He danced for those
At minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years
How his dog and him traveled about
His dog up and died, he up and died
After 20 years he still grieves

He said I dance now
At every chance in honky tonks
For drink and tips
But most of the time
I spend behind these county bars
Cause I drinks a bit

He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him
Please, please

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"

My Way



  (1968) Jacques Revaux, Claude Fran&ccedil;ois, Gilles Thibault, Paul Anka 

  And now, the end is near and so I got to face
The final curtain, girl
Friends I say clear and state her case of which I'm uncertain
I've lived a life that's full of travelled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yeah, regrets, I've had a few
But then again, who feel to me uncertain.
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each other course, each careful footstep along the byway,
Yeah, and more, much more than this,
I did my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you know
When I did all much more than I could do
But threw it all, when there was doubt, on everyday
And it's not enough, I faced it all
And as big as all did my way.

Oh, I've laughed and cried, had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, counted also music
To think like the old lad
And may I say not in a sky away,
Oh, no no no, You're not me, I did it my way.

What is a man, what have he got
If not himself, and he had not to may the things
He truly feels not words of one for use
With that shows, I took the blows and did it my way!

Seven angels having the seven last plagues
for in them is filled up the Wratrh of God
And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire
And them that had gotten the victory over the beast
And over his image
and over his mark
and over his name,
stand on the sea of glass
with the harps of God all around them.

He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen

They move in the shadows where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people and they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me, ""Kill them now or later?""

And so still at the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death

Rags And Old Iron



  Norman Curtis, Oscar Brown jr 

  Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
I heard that old rag man now making his rounds
He came right to my alley Lord with sorrowful sounds
Crying rags old iron and pulling his cart
Ask him how much he'd give me for my broken heart

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
So I asked that old rag man how much he would pay
For a heart that was broken baby when you went away
For a burnt out old love light that no longer beams
And a couple of slightly used second hand dreams

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
For those big empty promises you used to make
For those memories of you that are no longer sweet
I wish he could haul them off down the street

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
When love doesn't last tell me what is it worth
It was once mama's most precious possession on earth
When I asked that old rag man if he'd like to buy
He just shook his head and continued to cry

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
Rags old iron rags old iron

And your tenderness is needed too
And it seems that I’m never tired 
loving you, loving you
never was a feeling stronger
aching for the sweet things you do
and it seems that I’m never tired loving you
should the mountains crumble to ashes
and the rain should cease to fall
and if the river stopped its flowing
you’d still be my all in all
and if the clouds cover the sky
so the sunlight won’t come through
then I will never, never, never, never, never,

Dealing out the cards from left to right

Man, I'm all alone playing solitaire

Love was just another game for two
I see now that's all it's meant to you
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle
So I'm all alone playing solitaire

In each romance, there's an element of chance
A gamble to win or to lose
You play to win, then you find you're playing in a game with no rules
Just made for fools

Now, the joker has a laugh on me
'Cause I played my hand so carelessly
And until you wanna share that old feeling
I'll be dealin' time away with solitaire

And until you want to share that old feeling
Honey, I'll be dealin' time away
Dealin' time away with solitaire"

I know, I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude, I'm praying

Blood on the leaves and blood at the roots

Them big bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolia, clean and fresh

For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the leaves to drop

You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half crazy
And that's why you want to be there

And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
Just when you mean to tell her
That you have, that you have no love to give her

She gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
'Cause you've been, maybe you can trust her
She's touched your perfect body with her mind

Jesus was a sailor
When he walked across the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower

When he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said, ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""

But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
'Cause you think, maybe you can trust him
He's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters

And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look beneath the flowers
Beneath the flowers and the garbage

There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the mornin', they are leanin' out for love
They will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
'Cause you think, maybe you can can trust her
She's touched your perfect body with her mind"

Of a little heart that's been double crossed
The waiting's been so long so long

And nothing in this world will be too good for you

Yet every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see the light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place too high above this wall

Now yonder standing me in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
ALl day long I hear his voice shouting so loud
Crying out that he was framed

It'll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls

Throughout the land
And don't criticize

Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command

Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand

What the future has in store, no one ever knows before
Yet we would all like the right to find the key to success
That elusive ray of light that will lead to happiness

Tomorrow is my turn, no more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn, when my luck is returnin'
All these years, I've been learnin' to save fingers from burnin'
Tomorrow is my turn, no more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without givin'
Make life worth livin', now it's my life I'm livin'
And my only concern for tomorrow is my turn

Now the summer is gone, there's another to come
You can't stop years drifting by, even if you want to try
Though time may help you forget all that has happened before
But honey it's too late to regret, what is gone will be no more

Tomorrow is my turn, no more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn, when my luck is returnin'
All these years, I've been learnin' to save fingers from burnin'
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without givin'
To make life worth livin', now it's my life I'm livin'
And my only concern for tomorrow is my turn

Trouble in the Mind



  (1927) Richard Jones 

  Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor some day.

I'm all alone at midnight
And my lamp is burnin' low
Ain't never had so much
Trouble in my life before.

Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind,
Life ain't worth livin,
Sometimes I feel like dyin'.

Goin' down to the river
Gonna take my ol' rockin' chair
And if the blues don't leave me
I'll rock away from there.

You been a hard-hearted mama
Great God! You been unkind
Gonna be a cold, cold papa
Cause you to lose your mind.

I'm gonna lay my head down
On some lonesome railroad line
And let the two nineteen
Pacify my mind.

Well it's trouble, oh trouble
Trouble on my worried mind,
When you see me laughin'
I'm laughin' just to keep from cryin'."

Turning Point



See the little brown girl
She's as old as me
She looks just like chocolate
Oh mummy can't you see

We are both in first grade
She sits next to me
I took care of her mum
When she skinned her knee

She sang a song so pretty
On the Jungle Gym
When Jimmy tried to hurt her
I punched him in the chin

Mom, can she come over
To play dolls with me?
We could have such fun mum
Oh mum what'd you say

Why not? oh why not?
Oh. . . I. . . see. . ."

Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the Twelfth of Never
I'll still be loving you

Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow

I'll love you 'til the bluebells
Forget to bloom
I'll love you 'til the clover
Has lost its perfume
And I'll love you 'til the poets
Run out of rhyme
Until the Twelfth of Never
And that's a long, long time

Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow

Where can I go without you?

Tried seeing Singapore that wouldn't do
So I went Vienna but I found you there too
Even in Switzerland your memory came through
Where can I go without you?

I wanted to travel and I wanted romance
I just took off and chased my rainbow across the sea
But it's all over I'm tired of faces and quaint old places
Baby, if you won't be there with me

Back on the boat again farewell to France
So long West Germany it hasn't got a chance
I'll trade the sides I've seen for one loving glance

Gonna break this chain off to run

Original French Lyric

Il faut savoir encore sourire
Quand le meilleur s'est retiré
Et qu'il ne rest que le pire
Dans une vie prête à pleurer
Il faut savoir co&ucirc;te que co&ucirc;te
Garder toute sa dignité
Et malgré ce qu'il nous en co&ucirc;te
S'en aller sans se retourner
Face au destin qui nous désarme
Et devant le bonheur perdu
Il faut savoir cacher ses larmes
Mais moi mon coeur je n'ai pas su

Il faur savoir quitter la table
Lorsque l'amour est desservi
Sans s'accrocher l'air pitoyable
Mais partir sans faire de bruit
Il faur savoir cacher sa peine
Sous le masque de tous le jours
Et retenir le cris de haine
Qui sont le derniers mots d'amour

Il faut savoir rester de glace
Et taire un coeur qui meurt déjà
Il faut savoir garder la face
Mais moi je t'aime trop
Mais moi je ne peux pas
Il faut savoir mais moi
Je ne sais pas"

If you will go along with me into my father's hall Sir
You shall enjoy my maiden's head and my estate and all Sir

And when they came to father's home all moulded all about Sir
She stepped straight within the gate and shut the young man out Sir
Down deary down

Here is a pursue of gold she said take it for your pain Sir
And I will send my father's men to go home with you again Sir

Send me daddy, 'cause I don't care
I feel just like I wanna clown
Give the piano player a drink
Cause he brought me down

He's got rhythm when he stomps his feet
He just send me right off to sleep
Check all your razors and check your guns
I'm gonna be arrested when the wagon comes

I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer
Send me 'cause I don't care oh no
Send me 'cause I don't care"

Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you now

You've got the look of love it's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight, let this be just the start
Of so many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss

Sometimes the tears will flow
Some of my memories will fade
But I'll always remember that one September day

I used to reminisce
'Cause I thought that love was bliss
How did they know it would go astray
It began and it ended on one September day

We met by chance
As people often do
But it blossomed, yes it blossomed
Into something I never knew

Now, it is in the past
They said it would never last
I'll not forget the moment back
Nor hot May or December
Nor June or November
But one September day"

The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair

The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys thats scattered everywhere

And when her man comes to call
Hell find her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause when shes by his side
It's such a change from old routine

But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman will spend her life alone

But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman will spend her life alone"

He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin broken down

Where you looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don't know how to smile

Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
Is there anyone who knows?
Is there anyone who cares?

So you prayed to the Lord above
Please send you a friend
Yes you prayed to the Lord above
Please send you a friend
But your empty pockets tell you
That you ain't got no friends

Your babies are cryin' louder now
It's poundin' in your brain
Your babies are cryin' louder now
It's poundin' in your brain
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you
Like the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass is turnin' black
There's no water in your well
Your grass is turnin' black
There's no water in your well
You spent your last dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin' now
Your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin' now
Your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's poundin' roar

There's seven people dead
On a south Dakota farm
There's seven people dead
On a south Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
Seven new people are born"

Never had so much
Trouble in my life before

I'm all alone at midnight
And my lamp is burnin' low
Ain't never had so much

It's not 'cause I shouldn't

It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town

My poor heart is achin'
To bring home some bacon
And if I find myself alone and forsaken
It's simply because, I'm the laziest gal in town

Though I'm more than willing to learn
How these gals get so much extra money to burn
Every little proposition I just turn it down
Way down, yeah

The nights are cold
For love is old
Love was grand
When love was new

Birds were singin'
Skies were blue

This is the end
So why pretend

1716,Hip-Hop,Nina Simone,Miscellaneous ,Night Song (From Golden Boy) ,"Summer, not a bit of breeze
Neon signs are shining through the tired trees
Lovers walking to and fro
Everyone has someone and a place to go

Now listen, hear the cars go past
They don't even see me plying by so fast
Moving, going who knows where?
Only thing I know is I'm not going there

Where do you go, when you feel
That your brain is on fire?
Where do you go, when you don't even know
What it is you desire?

Listen, laughter everywhere
Hear it, life is in the air

As the night comes and the town awakes
Sound of children calling and the squeal of brakes
Music but a lonely song
When you can't help wondering where do I belong?"
1717,Hip-Hop,Nina Simone,Miscellaneous ,You Can Have Him ,"I don't want him, you can have him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from

I don't want him, you can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from

I'm afraid I never loved him
Sweetie he'd be better off with you
I could never make him happy

All I ever wanted to do was
Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks

Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he's read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch

Mornings after when he's had a little too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddles near
And give him babies one for every year

So you see that I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him 'cos I don't want him
Because he's not the man for me

Then I'd close the window while he soundly slept
Then I'd raid the icebox where the food is kept
I'd fix the breakfast that would please him most

Eggs and coffee some apricot juice and some buttered toast
Then I'd go out and buy the papers
And when they've been read spend the balance of the day in bed

So you see that I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him 'cos I don't want him, because he's not my man
I don't want him, you can have him, you can have him, I don't want him
You can have him, I don't want him 'cos he's not the man for me"

If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Doncha know that no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong you see some bad

Well, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ya know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
Then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get more than my share
But that's me, one thing I never mean to do

'Cause I love you, oh baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard
So don't let me be misunderstood"

That, I love you only, dear

I want some more and then some
Of how you feel and then
When you done, told me 'bout a million times how much you love me
And you're through start right back in again

I've made the same mistake, I know the awful ache
Of a little heart that's been double crossed
The waiting's been so long, so long it's hard to be believing
I thought I'd missed my guess I thought happiness for me was lost

I want more, some more, some more and then some
You know how I love that stuff
Whisper from now on till doomsday
But I never, no, no, no, no, I never know, I never will get enough"

Baby wears high peg pants, stripes are really yellow
When he starts into love me, he's so fine and mellow

Love will make you drink and gamble, make you stay out all night long
Love will make you drink and gamble, make you stay out all night long
Love will make you do things that you know is wrong

Do right baby if you stay home every day
I'll do right baby if you stay home every day
You're so mean and evil I know you're gonna drive me away

Why did he leave me? Why did he have to go?
Why did he leave me? Why did he have to go?
Went off and left me, baby I loved him so

I'll be a good wife to you if it means anything to you
I'll stay home every night and I'll love you and kiss you every night
And one of these days if you're good to me, honey
One of these days if God is good to me I'll bring you a little bunny

That dance before the flame
They burn their hearts so much

So foolishly they run, they run, they run
They run, they run, they run, they run
They run without a sound

I know the road they're on
I've walked their crooked mile
A hundred times or more
I drank their cup of bile
They watch their dreams go down
Be hind the settin' sun

Le he who threw the stone at them
Stand up and take a bow
He knows the verb ""to love""
Beu he'll never, never, never know how
On the bridge of nevermore
They disappear one by one
Disappear without a sound
The desperate ones

And underneath the bridge
The water's sweet and deep
This is their journey's end
The land of endless sleep
They cry to us for help
We think it's all in fun
They cry, they cry, they cry, they cry

Rien n'est jamais acquis l'homme, ni sa force
Ni sa faiblesse ni son cur, et quand il croit
Ouvrir ses bras son ombre est celle d'une croix
Et quand il croit serrer son bonheur il le broie
Sa vie est un trange et douloureux divorce

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Sa vie elle ressemble ces soldats sans armes
Qu'on avait habills pour un autre destin
A quoi peut leur servir de ce lever matin
Eux qu'on retrouve au soir dsarms incertains
Dites ces mots ma vie et retenez vos larmes

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Mon bel amour mon cher amour ma dchirure
Je te porte dans moi comme un oiseau bless
Et ceux-l sans savoir nous regardent passer
Rptant aprs moi les mots que j'ai tresss
Et qui pour tes grands yeux tout aussitÃ´t moururent

Le temps d'apprendre vivre il est dj trop tard
Que pleurent dans la nuit nos curs l'unisson
Ce qu'il faut de malheur pour la moindre chanson
Ce qu'il faut de regrets pour payer un frisson
Ce qu'il faut de sanglots pour un air de guitare

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Il n'y a pas d'amour qui ne soit douleur
Il n'y a pas d'amour dont on ne soit meurtri
Il n'y a pas d'amour dont on ne soit fltri

That hasn't always been easy to do
For just a single woman
Sometimes at night, the walls talk back to me
They seem to say, ""Wasn't yesterday a better day?""

Always alone at home or in a crowd
A single woman out on a private cloud
Caught in a world few people understand
I am what I am, only one single woman

There was a time, I can't remember when
The house was full of love
But then again it might have been imaginations plan
Just to help along, one single woman"

A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance"

But the age of miracles, it hadn't past
And suddenly, I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town, the sun was shining everywhere"

Just as I want to anyway
And don't care just what people say
If I should take a notion
To jump into the ocean
Ain't nobody's business if I do
If I go to church on Sunday
Then cabaret all day Monday
Ain't nobody's business if I do
If my man ain't got no money
And I say ""take all mine, honey""
Ain't nobody's business if I do
If I give him my last nickel
And it leaves me in a pickle
Ain't nobody's business if I do
But I'd rather my man would hit me
Than follow him to jump up and quit me
Ain't nobody's business if I do

Ain't nobody's business if I do
Nobody's business

And if I fell under the spell of your call

Autumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first-nighting.
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel; they're making me feel I'm home.
It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love.  Autumn in New

George Cory / Douglass Cross

Lonely grief is hounding me
Like the lonely shadow hounding me
It's always there just out of sight
Like a fragling tree on a lightening night
Lonely wind cries out my name

Sad as haunted music in the rain
It's born of grief and born of woe
But I hear it call and I've got to go
Where can I be headed for
The blues call in my north
To lick my heart once more
Love lives in a lonely land
Where there's no helping hand to understand
Why does it bring this hate to me
Why it don't matter why
I only know misery has to be part of me
Never hope to count on love
To be a partner of that heaven above
Never hope to understand
Love is a barrel land
A lonely land, a lonely land"

Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And I am livin' for you alone
Did I remember to say
I'm lost without you
And just how mad about you I've grown
You were in my arms
And that was all I knew
We were alone, we two
What did I say to you
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And pray forevermore you'll be mine"

DO NOTHIN' TILL YOU HEAR FROM ME
Duke Ellington / Bob Russell

Some-one told some-one and some-one told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much,
Since ev'ryone spread the story
With his own little personal touch.

Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head.
Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you.
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will."

Do you know what is means to miss New Orleans
I miss it, each night and day
The longer I stay away
Miss the moist covered vines
The tall sugar pines
Where mocking birds use to sing
And I like to see the lazy Mississippi
Are hurrying to spring
The Mardi Gras memories
Of creol tunes that fill the air

And soon I'm wishing that I was there

Good morning heartache
You old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache
Thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seems you heve gone
But here you are with the dawn
Wish I forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you
When my love went away
Now everyday I stop I'm saying to you
Good morning heartache what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you nohow
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight to Sunday blues
Good morning heartache
Here we go again
Good morning heartache
You're the one
Who knows me well
Might as well get use to you hanging around
Good morning heartache

Where's the one from whom I'll never part?
First they hurt me, then desert me
I'm left alone, all alone

There's no house that I can call my home
There's no place from which I'll never roam
Town or city, it's a pity
I'm left alone, all alone

Seek and find they always say
But up to now it's not that way
Maybe fate has let him pass me by

Hearts will open, but until then

Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky

Life is bare, gloom and mis'ry everywhere

Just can't get my poorself together,
I'm weary all the time
So weary all the time
When he went away the blues walked in and met me.
If he stays away old rockin' chair will get me.

All I do is pray the Lord above will let me walk in the sun once more.
Can't go on, ev'ry thing I had is gone
Stormy weather

Since my man and I ain't together,
keeps rainin' all the time"

STRANGE FRUIT
Lewis Allen

Southern trees bear strange fruit,
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.

Pastoral scene of the gallant south,
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh,
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop,
Here is a strange and bitter crop."

So I talk a little too much, and I laugh a little too much
And my voice is too loud, when I'm out in a crowd
So that people are apt to stare

Do they know, do they care, that it's only that I'm lonely
and low as can be?
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at atll!

So I smoke a little too much, and I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request are not always the best
But the ones where the trumpets blare!

VIOLETS FOR YOUR FURS
It was winter in Manhattan
Falling snowflakes filled the air
The streets were covered with a film of ice
But a little simple magic that I'd heard about somewhere
Changed the weather all around, just within a trice

You bought me violets for my furs
And it was spring for a while, remember?
You bought me violets for my furs
And there was april in that december
The snow drifted on the flowers and melted where it lay
The snow looked like dew on the blossoms
As on a summer day

You bought me violets for my furs
And there was blue in the wintry sky
You pinned the violets to my furs
And gave a lift to the crowds passing by
You smiled at me so sweetly
Since then one thought occurs
That we fell in love completely
The day you bought me violets for my furs"

Gordon Jenkins / Tom Adair

I'm just about fed up
I've finally had my fill
Of sitting around and crying in my beer
I've drunk the bitter cup
I've downed the bitter pill
While waiting for the silver lining to appear

I'm going to stack my blues up
On the very highest shelf
I'm going to pack my blues up
And get wise to myself

(Weep no more, my baby)
(Weep no more, my baby)
Weep no more
I'm going to weep no more
I'm putting an end to this lonesome game
(It's such a lonesome game this crying)

Cry no tears, I'm going to cry no tears
Each time that I happen to hear his name
(I hear his name)
I'm going out on the town
This hopeless torch I will drown
'Cause I'm tired of running around
(Running around)
With just a memory
Weep no more, I'm going to weep no more
Till somebody weeps
(Until somebody weeps) For me"

For parting is not goodbye

Folks down there live a life of ease
When the twilight brings the evening breeze
It's sleepy time down south
Steamboats on the river, a coming, a going
Splashing the night away

Hear those banjos ringing,
The folks are all singing
They dance till break of day
Dear old Southland with its dreamy songs
Takes back there where I belong

My mother's son-in-law.
Needn't even think of tryin'
To be a mighty social lion
Sipping tea, if you'll be
My mother's son-in-law,
Ain't got the least desire
To set the world on fire
Just wish you'd make it proper
To call my old man papa
You don't have to sing like Bledsoe
You can tell the world I said so
Can't you see you've got to be
My mother's son-in-law.

A heart in search of happiness
You showed me the way

My sky was so gray
I never knew I'd feel a thrill
I couldn't dream a dream until
You showed me the way

The moment you found me
The shadows around me
Just disappeard from view
The world became rosy
Each corner so cozy
Darling, all because of you
You showed me the way
And if I've learned that love can be a paradise
For you and me
Here's all I can say
You showed me the way"

I suffer something awful each time you go

The weather there is nice and warm
The climate's of the southern brand

Who's colder than an arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even nice men leave her alone

They call her, ""Hard hearted Hannah""
The vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Leather is tough but Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer

To tease them and thrill 'em
To torture and kill 'em
Is her delight they say

I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah pourin' water on a drownin' man

She's hard hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah, G A

The call her, ""Hard hearted Hannah""
The vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Talk of your cold refrigerating mamas
Brother she's a polar bears pajamas

To tease them and thrill 'em
To torture and kill 'em
Is her delight they say

An evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like travelin' through Alaska in your BVDs

She's hard hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah, G A

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She's got the right name, ""The vamp of Savannah""

Start pourin' water on a drownin' man

I might as well play bridge with my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance this is a fine romance

You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins to express emotion

A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease in your blue serge pants
I never get the chance this is a fine romance"

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
British Museum had lost its charm

How long, I wondered could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine

I'll still not go in mourning
Though my reputation
Is blemished, I'm afraid.

With just one kiss
What heaven, what rapture, what bliss

Honestly, I thought you wouldn't.
Naturally, you thought you couldn't.
And probably we shouldn't.
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Actually, it all was blameless.
Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless
So let's keep the lady nameless
But aren't you kind of glad we did?

Socially, I'll be an outcast
Obviously, we dined alone
On my good name there will be doubt cast
With never a sign of any chaperone.

No matter how they may construe it
Whether or not, we have to rue it
Whatever made us do it
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?

Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands

On the benches in central park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get, off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Couldn't eat, was dispeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Romance, finis. Your chance, finis
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered no more"

I cook the kippers, laugh at his oldest jokes
Yet here I anchor, I might have had a banker
Boy! what love has done to me

His nature's funny, quarrelsome half the time
And as for money, he hasn't got a dime
And here's the joker, I might have had a broker
Boy! what love has done to me

When a guy looks my way
Does he get emphatic, say he gets dramatic?
I just wanna fly 'way
But if I left him I'd be all at sea

I'm just a slavey, life is a funny thing
He's got the gravy, I got a wedding ring
And still I love him, there's nobody above him
Boy! what love has done to me

His brains are minus,
Never a thought in sight
And yet his highness
Lectures me day and night;
Oh where was my sense
To sign that wedding licence?
Boy! What love has done to me!

My life he's wrecking, bet you could find him now
Out somewhere necking somebody else's frau
You get to know life when married to a low life
Boy! what love has done to me

I can't hold my head up
The butcher, the baker, oh no he's a faker
Brother I am fed up
But if I left him he'd be up a tree

But I have grown so, I love that dirty so-and-so

Boy Wanted
Verse:
I've just finished writing an advertisement
Calling for a boy.
No half-hearted Romeo or flirt is meant;
That's the kind I'd not employ.
Though anybody interested can apply,
He must know a thing to qualify.
For instance:

Refrain 1:
Teddy:
He must be able to dance.
he must make life a romance.
I said a boy wanted,
One who can smile;
Boy wanted,
Lovable style.
He must be tender and true,
And he must know how to woo.
I know we'll get acquainted mighty soon,
Out in a garden 'neath a harvest moon;
And if he proves to be the right little laddie,
I'll make him glad
He'll answer my ad!

Refrain 2:
Toots:
To be the boy of my choice,
He needn't own a Rolls Royce.
The kind of boy wanted*
Needn't have gold;
Boy wanted,
Mustn't be cold.
If he has oodles of charm,
I'll even life on a farm.
if he fits into my picture of a home,
I'll be so nice he'll never have to roam.**
Yes, if he proves to be the right little laddie,
I'll make him glad
He answered my ad.

Refrain 3:
Babe:
He must like musical shows,
And he must wear snappy clothes.
Yes, that is my story,
And to it I'll stick;
There's no glory
In having a hick.
He must know how to say ""Yes!""***
When I look at a new dress.
Oh, I'll be ready when the right one calls,
And I'll start vamping him until he falls;
And if he subsidises me, oh, sweet daddy!
I'll make him glad
He answered my ad!

Refrain 4:
Bunny:
The movies he must avoid,
He'll know his Nietzsche and Freud.
I said a boy wanted,
One who knows books;
Boy wanted
Needn't have looks.
He must be such a saint,
But, Oh! he dassent say 'ain't.'

I don't care if his bankroll totals naught,
For we can live on love and food for thought.
If he's a scholar, when I see him I'll holler,
'My lad, I'm glad
You answered my ad!'

*Alternative version of this line: 'The sort of boy wanted'
** Alternative version of this line: 'I'll be so nice he'll never care

And he must love like a sheik.'

No half-hearted Romeo or flirt is meant;
That's the kind I won't employ.
Though anybody interested can apply,
He must know a thing to qualify.
For instance:

Refrain 1:
To have a ghost of a chance,
He must be able to dance.
The sort of boy wanted
Must have a smile
Boy wanted,
Lovable style.
He must be tender and true,
And if he knows what to do,
I think I'll learn to love him very soon;
I'll want him morning, night and afternoon.
So if you know of one who's wanting employment,
Just tell him that
I'm wanting a boy!

Refrain 2:
To be the boy of my choice,
He's got to own a Rolls Royce.
He must be quite reckless
Buying me things:
Pearl necklace,
Diamond rings.
He must be ready to pay
A dozen bills ev'ry day.
I'll simply smothing him with tender care
If I could find a multimillionaire.
So if you could seen one dining at the Savoy-oh!
Just tell him
I'm wanting a boy!

Refrain 3:
I won't have anyone small,
He must be handsome and tall.
I said a boy wanted,
Beautifully dressed;
Boy wanted,
Trousers well pressed.
He must have wonderful eyes;
He must wear wonderful ties.
I want a boy who'll always look as though
He's only just come out of Savile Row.
So if some Paris wants a Helen of Troy-oh!
Just tell him that
I'm wanting a boy."

What a fool, now I see the way this ends
I'll let him turn me down and say

He was sigh and wonder why?

What a flop, this is how the story ends

And to reach the highest peak

As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through

To heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Come on and dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through

And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Out together dancing cheek to cheek

With your lips touching his face?

I'm longing to be in his place?

Won't you change partners
And dance with me?

Ask him to sit this one out
And while you're alone
I'll tell the waiter to tell him
He's wanted on the telephone

You've been locked in his arms
Ever since heaven knows when

Won't you change partners

To change partners again

Seemed made for just a boy and girl

Never stopping -
To find at night no work has been done.

Once it didn't matter -
But now you're doing wrong;
When you start to patter

After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get, off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Couldn't eat, was dispeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Romance, finis. Your chance, finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis.

Mmmm (scat)

I've got the ""You don't know the half of it, dearie"" blues
Oh how I wish you'd drop that anger, and end your cruise

Caught a blue bird by the toe, a rainbow by the tail
A certain man with eyes that shine
Voodooed up this heart of mine

It seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe
He's got a smile that makes the lilac wanna grow
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by

Sometime the cabin's gloomy and the table bare
Then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere
Troubles fly away and life is easy go
Does he love me? Good that's all I need to know
Seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe

Little Joe

The Buzzard Song
PORGY
Boss, dat bird mean trouble.
Once de buzzard fold his wing an' light over yo' house,
all yo' happiness done dead.
Buzzard keep on flyin' over, take along yo' shadow.
Ain' nobody dead dis mornin'
Livin's jus' begun.
Two is strong where one is feeble;
man an' woman livin', workin',
Sharin' grief an' sharin' laughter,
An' love like Augus' sun.
Trouble, is dat you over yonder
lookin' lean an' hungry?
Don' you let dat buzzard keep you
hangin' round my do'.
Ain' you heard de news this mornin'?
Step out, brudder, hit de gravel;
Porgy who you used to feed on,
Don' live here no mo'
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Buzzard, on yo' way!
Ole age, what is you anyhow,
nuttin' but bein' lonely.
Pack yo' things an' fly from here,
Carry grief an' pain.
Dere's two folks livin' in dis shelter
Eatin', sleepin', singin', prayin'.
Ain' no such thing as loneliness.
An' Porgy's young again.

PORGY AND CHORUS
Buzzard, keep on flyin',
Porgy's young again.

2061,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Over the Rainbow ,"When all the world is a hopeless jumble
And the raindrops tumble all around
Heaven opens a magic lane

When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found
Leading from your window pane
To a place behind the sun, just a step beyond the rain

Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Someday day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow, why, then oh, why can't I?

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow why, then oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?"

And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can't understand I get misty just holding your hand

Walk my way and a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear I get misty the moment you're near

Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own when I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove, I'm too misty and too much in love

Too misty and too much in love"

Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig
You're looking' in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
That this could be the start of something big

You're lunching at Twenty-One and watchin' your diet
Declining a charlotte russe, accepting a fig
When out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy
And this could be the start of something big

There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend
Who knows what's written in the magic book
But when a lover you discover at the gate my friend
Invite her in without a second look

You're up in an aeroplane or dining at Sardi's
Or lying at Malibu alone on the sand
You suddenly hear a bell, and right away you can tell
That this could be the start of something grand

This could be the start of something very big
Why don't you play your part?
Please give your heart to me and see
This could be the start of something wonderful
Why don't you take a chance?
Just try romance with me and see

Your watchin' the sun come up and countin' your money
Or else in a dim cafe you're ordering wine
Then suddenly there he is, and you wanna be where he is
And this must be the start of something
This could be the heart of something
This could be the start of something big"

Nobody loves me

All by myself in the night

So unhappy there

All by myself I get lonely
Watching the clock on the shelf
I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older

You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

And that alone is more than I was created for

Want you to know I go for your squeezing
Want you to know it really is pleasing
Want you to know I ain't for no teasing

Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me

Missing you since you went away, singin' the blues away each day
Counting the nights and waiting for you
I'm in the mood to let you know, I never knew I loved you so
Please say you love me too

When I get this feeling, I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but don't tease me

Missing you since you went away, singin' the blues away each day
Counting the nights and waiting for you
I'm in the mood to let you know, I never knew I loved you so
Please say you love me too

When I get this feeling I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me
Come on and squeeze me but please don't tease me
Hear me honey, talkin'
Squeeze me but please don't tease me"
2089,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered ","After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laughs on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dis peptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Romance, finis, your chance, finis
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered no more"
2090,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,The Lady Is a Tramp ,"I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew
And never wished for Turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too
From Maine to Albuquerque

Alas I missed the Beaux Arts Ball and what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Cad
But social circles spin too fast for me
My hobohemia is the place to be

I get too hungry for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care I'm broke it's okay
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight that isn't a fake
I love the rowing on Central Park Lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that
I'm alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp"
2091,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Georgia on My Mind ,"Georgia
Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia
On my mind

Georgia, a song of you
Comes as sweet and clean as moonlight
Through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The roads leads back to you

Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia
On my mind

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The roads leads back to you

Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia
On my mind
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia
On my mind"
2092,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Mountain Greenery ,"On the first of May
It is moving day
Spring is here, so blow your job
Throw your job away

Now's the time to trust
To your wanderlust
In the city's dust you wait
Must you wait, just you wait

In a mountain greenery
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy
People together

While you love your lover
Let blue skies be your cover
Let, when it rains
We'll laugh at the weather

And if you're good
I'll search for wood
So you can cook
While I stand lookin'

Beans could get no keener
Reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain
Greenery home

Mosquitoes here
Won't bite you dear
I'll let them sting
Me on the finger

We could find no cleaner
Retreat from life's machinery
Than our mountain
Greenery home"
2093,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,One Note Samba (Samba De Uma Nota So) ,"This is just a little samba
Built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow
But the root is still that note

Now this new note is the consequence
Of the one we've just been through
As I'm bound to be
The unavoidable consequence of you

There's so many people
Who can talk and talk, and talk
And just say nothing
Or nearly nothing

I have used up all the scale
I know and at the end
I've come to nothing
I mean nothing

So I come back to my first note
As I come back to you
I will pour into that one note
All the love I feel for you

Any one who wants the whole show
Re mi fa so la ci do
He will find himself with no show
Better play the note you know

So I come back to my first note
I must come back to you
I will pour into that one note
All the love I feel for you

Any one who wants the whole show
Re mi fa so la ci do
He will find himself with no show
Better play the note you know"
2094,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Somewhere in the Night ,"Somewhere in the night, chasing shadows around the bend
Somewhere in the night, chasing rainbows that have no end
In the misty night, you are mine and you hold me tight

But dreams have a way of calling it a day
My dreams have past, they seldom last
But in my lonely flight, I'll keep searching till day is through
And somewhere in the night, till I find you

Somewhere in the night, [Incomprehensible]"
2095,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,"Baby, It's Cold Outside ","I really can't stay
But, baby, it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think
But baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, Sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Oh, baby don't hold out, baby
Ahh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go
But, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no
But, baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh, your lips are delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old out, baby
Ahh, but it's cold outside

Where could you be going
When the wind is blowing and it's cold outside?
Baby, it's cold, cold outside"
2096,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Johnny One Note ,"Johnny could only sing one note
And the note he sang was this

Ah, poor Johnny one note sang out with gusto
And just overlorded the place
Poor Johnny one note, yelled willy nilly
Until he was blue in the face
For holding one note was his ace

Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class, by himself, by gum

Poor Johnny one note got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave
He took his one note, howled like the north wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned round in his grave

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Every one was mute, Johnny stood alone

Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo, all were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunder claps stopped clapping
Traffic ceased its roar
And they tell us Niagara stood still

He stopped the train whistles, boat whistles
Steam whistles, cop whistles, all whistles bowed to his skill

Sing Johnny one note, sing out with gusto
And just overwhelm all the crowd
Ah, so sing Johnny one note, out loud
Sing Johnny one note
Sing Johnny one note out loud"
2097,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,I Can't Face the Music ,"Till the tick tick tock of your mantle clock
Sounds like a jungle drum
You've never been blue, I don't mind tellin' you

When the wear and tear on your rocking chair
Is as plain as an old sore thumb
You say I gotta right to scream out in the night

Breeze, stop moaning those weird melodies
My man has left me and I can't face the music
Without singin' the blues

Rain, your rhythm on my window pane
Drives me insane because I can't face the music
Without singin' the blues

My heart is so broken I've spoken
To the Lord for sympathy
And if He don't help me, so help me
It's the bottom of the deep blue sea for me

I'm gonna end this misery
My man has left me and I can't face the music
Without singing the blues

My heart is so broken I've spoken
To the Lord for sympathy
And if He don't help me, so help me
It's the bottom of the deep blue sea for me

I'm gonna end this misery
My man has left me and I can't face the music
Without singing the blues

Why don't you stop this foolin' around
You know your love has gotten me down
'Cause with out you
I know I keep singin' these same old blues"

2099,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,You Go to My Head ,"You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that you might give
A thought to my plea cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes
My temperature rise like a summer with a thousand Julies
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

You go to my head
You go to my head

The thrill of the thought that you might give
A thought to my plea cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes
My temperature rise like a summer with a thousand Julies
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

You go to my head
You go to my head"
2100,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Stormy Weather ,"Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather, since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather, just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all the time

When he went away the blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray, the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on, everything I had is gone
Stormy weather, since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time

I walk around heavy-hearted and sad
Night comes around and I'm still feeling bad
Rain pourin' down, blinding every hope I had
This pitter an' patter an' beatin' an' spatterin', drivin' me mad

Love, love, love, love
This misery will be the end of me

When he went away the blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray, the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on, everything I had is gone
Stormy weather, since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time, the time
Keeps raining all the time"

My lonely days are over and life is like a song
Oh yeah, yeah at last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clovers

The night I looked at you I found a dream that
I could speak to a dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah, you smiled you smiled
Oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last"

He brings my coffee in my favorite cup

That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know he'll go with me until the end
Everybody ask me how I know
I smile at them and say he told me so

That's why I know, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so

Now if I call him on the telephone
And tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear him knock, knock, knock, knock
On my door

In the evening when the sun does down
When there is nobody else around
He kisses me and he holds me tight
And tells me, ""Baby, everything's alright""

That's why I know, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so

Now if I call him on the telephone
And tell him that I'm all alone

How long, how long, baby how long?

Heard the whistle blowin', couldn't see the train
Way down in my heart I had an achin' pain
How long, how long, how long?

If I could holler like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain and call my baby back
I went up on the mountain, looked as far as I could see
The man had my woman and the blues had poor me

I can see the green grass growin' on the hill
But I ain't seen the green grass on a dollar bill
I'm goin' down to Georgia, been up in Tennessee
So look me over baby, last you'll see of me

The brook runs into the river, river runs into the sea
If I don't run into my baby, a train is goin' to run into me"

When I get back to my chilly hallroom
I'm much too tired to sleep
I'm one of those lady teachers, a beautiful hostess you know

One that the palace features at exactly a dime a throw
Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
Gosh how they weigh me down
Ten cents a dance, pansies and rough guys

Tough guys who tear my gown
Seven to midnight I hear drums
Loudly the saxophone blows
Trumpets are tearing my ear-drums, customers crush my toes

Sometimes I think, I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket
Come on big boy, ten cents a dance

Fighters and sailors and bow-legged tailors
Can pay for their tickets and rent me
Butchers and barbers and rats from the harbor
Are sweethearts my good luck has sent me

Thought I've a chorus of elderly bows
Stockings are porous with holes at the toes
I'm here till closing time
Dance and be merry it's only a dime

Sometimes I think, I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket
Come on, come on big boy, ten cents a dance"

There'll come a time, when you'll regret it

After you've gone, after you've gone away

After I'm gone, after we break up

Just the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearin' my fear apart

Touches my foolish heart

Charming, never, never change
Keep that breathless charm

Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint

I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain, upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings

This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands

I know, I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it that's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

I love you, love you madly

I love you
Love you madly
I love you madly
Oh, I got big eyes for you, baby"

And the bagpipes are reversin'
While McPherson is rehearsin' to swing
And from Edinburgh to Dundee
Every lad and every lassie

Ooh, I dinna care said, Sandy

And ther's truckin' in the heather

Just glad I'm livin' and happy to be
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She'd never holler, she'd live in a tent
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

Though she'd love to work and slave for me every day
She'd be so much better off if I went away

But why should I leave her, why should I go?
She'd be unhappy without me, I know
I got a woman, crazy for me

When I hurt her feelin's once in a while
Her only answer is one little smile
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way"

Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shove again
Putting rain in my eyes, tears in my dreams
And rocks in my heart

It's that sly old sun of a gun again
He keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that rain still have those tears
And those rocks in my heart

Suppose I didn't stay, ran away, wouldn't play
The devil, what a potion he would brew?

He'd follow me around, build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered, I wouldn't know what to do

Might as well give up that fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me, that he's right again
When he sings that sorry song I'm just gonna tag along
With that old devil called love

He'd follow me around, build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered, I wouldn't know what to do

With that old devil called love
With that old devil called love"

Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss

I like pie, I hope to die
Just get a load of this
When you get high, dog, gone the pie
Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss

Peaches, bananas and everything good

I love jam and no flim flam
Scratch that off of my list
There's ain't no jam, the jam can scram
Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss

I like cars and big cigars
But baby they won't me missed
If everyday I hear you say
Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss

I crave sights like Title fights
But if you should insist
I'd cancel nights at Title fights
Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss

Yes, it's wise to compromise
In such cases as this
There's nothing worth the light in your eyes
What can compare with the thrill of your kiss

Oh baby, oh baby
Baby, c'mon and knock me a kiss"

Without him I'm less than a decimal

Think about letting the rest of the world go fly a kite

Drifts a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss
You make my paradise complete

Rose petals seem to fall
It's all I could dream to call you mine
My heart's a lighter thing
Since you made this night a thing divine

For I never dreamt that you'd be loving sentimental me

A few kisses ago
I remember you you're the one who said ""I love you, too""
I do, didn't you know?

I remember too
A distant bell and stars that fell
Like the rain out of the blue

When my life is through
And the Angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them I remember you

Try and believe
Life is always sunshine

When the heart beats true
Banish your fears
Smile through your tears

When you're sad
It makes me feel the same as you
Come to me, my melancholy baby

Cuddle up and don't be blue
All your fears are foolish fancy, maybe
You know, dear, that I'm in love with you

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through
Come on and smile, my honey dear

While I kiss away each tear
Or else I shall be melancholy too"

From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape, it's much too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love

What's the good of my caring
If someone is sharing those arms with me?

Upon my knees to him I'm creeping
My very soul is in his keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love"

What learning I've got
I won't waste any time
I'll strike while the iron is hot

If they asked me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot

I took one look at you, that's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Soon he will open the door
Don't think because there's a ring on your finger
You needn't try any more

For wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment that he comes home to you
I'm warning you

Day after day, there are girls at the office
And the men will always be men
Don't stand him up, with your hair still in curlers
You may not see him again

Wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
He's almost here, hey, little girl, better wear something pretty
Something you wear to go to the city

Dim all the lights, pour the wine
Start the music, time to get ready for love
Time to get ready for love, yes it's time to get ready for love
It's time to get ready, kick your shoes off, baby"

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep"

Why mess around with strife'
I never was cut out to step and strut out
Give me the simple life

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant
Those things roll off my knife
Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes
Give me the simple life

A cottage small if all I'm after
Not one that's spacious and wide
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside

Some like the high road, I like the low road
Free from the care and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed
Give me the simple life"

Gladly broken-hearted

Worrying is through
I sleep all night
Appetite and health restored
You don't know how much I'm bored

The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversations with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane but I would rather be gaga

The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mismating of a him and her
I've learned my lesson
But I wish I were in love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words, ""I love you, 'til the day I dieâ€
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No more care, no despair
I'm all there now, but I'd rather be punchdrunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle of a him and her
I don't like quiet
And I wish I were in love again"
2147,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,I'm Beginning to See the Light (1957 Version) ,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by a lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light

I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park

Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light

Now that the stars are in your eyes

Now when you turn the lamp down low

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark

Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby amorous

It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much, too much
And just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's dictionary

And so, I'm borrowing
A love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words

A love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words"

'Cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea

I oughta cross you off my list
But when you come knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more

I should hate you

Are the luckiest people in the world

We're children needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world

With one person, one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half, now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people

Making a heaven for two
With the tender, sweet surrender
Coming from someone like you

You're perfection, to affection
Being a perfect design
Love has found us, joy has found us
Planning a future divine

No indecision, I know that my vision is clear
When you are new, no need for sunlight
For you are the one light
I see so real to me

Love and kisses, that's what bliss is
That thing whatever you do
Full completeness, whispered sweetness
Coming from someone like you"

What love can do
I'd give all my possessions
For you

I'm in good conditions
And I've got ambition
That belongs to you

Six shirts and collars
Debts beyond endurance
On my life insurance
That belongs to you

I've got a heart
That must be spurtin'
Just be certain
I'll be true

Take my five dollars
Take my shirts and collars
Take my heart that hollers
Everything I've got belongs to you

I've got five dollars
Eighty-five relations
Two lace combinations
They belong to you

Two coats with collars
Ma and grandma wore 'em
All the moths adore 'em
They belong to you

I've got two lips
That care for mating
Therefore waiting
Will not do

Take my five dollars
Take my coats and collars
Take my heart that hollers
Everything I've got belongs to you"

It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
'Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
'Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me.

2157,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Sophisticated Lady ,"They say into your early life romance came
And in this heart of yours burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away

Then with disillusion deep in your eyes
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise
The years have changed you, somehow, I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want?

No, sophisticated lady
I know, you miss the love you lost long ago
And when nobody is nigh you cry

And just like the guy who's feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit

Those raindrops are falling on my head
They keep falling

So I just did me some talking to the sun
And said, I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job

Those raindrops are falling on my head
They keep falling

But there's one thing, I know
The blues they sent to greet me, won't defeat me
It won't be long for happiness steps up to meet me

Raindrops falling on my head
And even though my eyes are seem to be turning red
Crying's not for me

'Cause I'm not complaining about the rain that keeps falling
Because I'm free and nothing's worryin' me
Nothing's worryin' me, nothing's worryin' me

But there's one thing, I know
The blues they sent to meet me, won't defeat me

Because I'm free and nothing's worryin' me
No no, nothing's worryin' me

Happy days, nothing's worryin' me
Happy days, nothing's worryin' me
Watch the rain, yeah, falling on my head

Oh, heaven is in your eyes
While the wind is sobbing
Underneath the stars
Both our hearts are throbbing
Like two guitars

Love here in the starlit hour
Night whispering lullabies
Let me dream forever
Underneath the silvery skies

Will it be just as sweet again
The glamor, the glory that we know?
Will I find when we meet again
The glamor, the glory's still a glow?

But tonight, let us forget tomorrow
Here under the midnight blue
Love will bloom and flower
In the starlit hour with you"

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Wouldn't I be glad to take you
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Man of my heart I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Man of my heart I'll string along
You need me so
More than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But honey I can't live without it

If you got tired and said ""Goodbye""
More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know"

Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street

Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'll be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade

I don't care if my hairdo is in place
I've lost the very meaning of repose
I never put a mudpack on my face

Oh who'd have thought that I'd walk in a daze
Now I never go to shows at night but just to matinees
Now I see the show
And home I go

Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

Once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one
It never entered my mind

You have what I lack myself
And now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me
That if you scorned me
I'd sing the maiden's prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

You have what I lack myself

Or if it's dark or fair
Somehow that's just the way it is
And I don't really care

I go to this or that place
I seem alive and well
My head is just a hat place
My breast an empty shell
And I've a faded dream to sell

All alone, all at sea
Why does nobody care for me?
When there's no love to hold my love
Why is my heart so frail?
Like a ship without a sail

Out on the ocean
Sailors can use a chart
I'm on the ocean
Guided by just a lonely heart

Still alone, still at sea
Still there's no one to care for me
When there's no hand to hold my hand
Life is a loveless tale
For a ship without a sail

Still alone, still at sea
Still there's no one to care for me
When there's no hand to hold my hand
Life is a love, loveless tale
For a ship without a sail"
2170,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,To Keep My Love Alive ,"I've been married, and married, and often I've sighed
""I'm never a bridesmaid, I'm always the bride""
I never divorced them, I hadn't the heart
Yet, remember these sweet words, ""Till death do us part""

I married many men, a ton of them
Because I was untrue to none of them
Because I bumped off every one of them
To keep my love alive

Sir Paul was frail, he looked a wreck to me
At night he was a horse's neck to me
So I performed an appendectomy
To keep my love alive

Sir Thomas had insomnia, he couldn't sleep at night
I bought a little arsenic, he's sleeping now all right

Sir Philip played the harp, I cussed the thing
I crowned him with his harp to bust the thing
And now he plays where harps are just the thing
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive

I thought Sir George had possibilities
But his flirtations made me ill at ease
And when I'm ill at ease, I kill at ease
To keep my love alive

Sir Charles came from a sanatorium
And yelled for drinks in my emporium
I mixed one drink, he's in memoriam
To keep my love alive

Sir Francis was a singing bird, a nightingale, that's why
I tossed him off my balcony, to see if he could fly

Sir Atherton indulged in fratricide
He killed his dad and that was patricide
One night I stabbed him by my mattress side
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive"
2171,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,With a Song in My Heart ,"Though I know that we meet every night
And we couldn't have changed since the last time
To my joy and delight
It's a new kind of love at first sight

Though it's you and it's I all the time
Every meeting's a marvelous pastime
You're increasingly sweet
So whenever we happen to meet

I greet you with a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start
But it's soon is a hymn to your grace

When the music swells
I'm touching your hand
It tells that you're standing near, and
At the sound of your voice

Heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you"

Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn
Goodnight, baby, goodnight, milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby, sleep tight, let's call it a day

Come on along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway
The hi-de-hi and boop-boop-buh-doo, the lullaby of Broadway
The band begins to go to town and everyone goes crazy
You rock-a-bye your baby 'round 'til everything gets hazy

Hush-a-bye, I'll gonna buy you this and that you hear your daddy sing

Singin' like they did before

That ol' storm broke out
And my man walked off
And left me in the rain

Though he's gone I doubt
If he'll stay away for good
I'd stop livin' if he should

Love is funny, it's not always
Peaches, cream and honey
Just when everything looked
Bright and sunny

Suddenly the cyclone came
I'll never be the same
'Til that sun comes out
And the rain stops beatin'
On my window pane

If my heart holds out
Let it rain and let it pour
It may not be long before
There's a knockin' at my door

Then you'll know
The one I love walked in
When the sun comes out

Love is funny, it's not always
Peaches, cream and honey
Just when everything looked
Bright and sunny

Suddenly the cyclone came
I'll never be the same
'Til that sun comes out
And the rain stops beatin'
Beatin' on my window pane

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us
To fill the night with a song

We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us
As we go drifting along

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill
Can't we sail away on a little dream
And settle high on the crest of a thrill

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely, lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven
To climb to heaven with you

Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
Yes, we're climbing
Climbing to the stairway to the stars, stars, stars, stars

Sound of violins
Way out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us
As we go drift, drift, drifting along

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill
Can't we sail away on a little dream
And settle high on the crest of a thrill

Keep building a stairway to the stars

It wouldn't be heaven
Heaven to climb with you"

Starting with the ABC of it
Getting right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, ""I love you""
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear my love
Teachers shouldn't stand so near my love
Graduation's almost here my love
You'd better teach me tonight

I've played loves scenes in a flick or two
And I've also met a chick or two
But I still can learn a trick or two
Hey, teach me tonight

I who thought I knew the score of it
Kind of think I should know much more of it
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it
Hey, teach me tonight

The midnight hours come slowly creeping
When there's no one there but you
There must be more to life than sleeping
Single in a bed for two

What I feel is hard to articulate
If you want me to matriculate
You'd better teach me tonight

Teach me, come on and teach me

Let him hold out his hand
Let him touch you and watch what happens

One, someone who can look in your eyes
And see into your heart

And put rocks in my bed

All night long I weep
So how can I sleep
With rocks in my bed

There's only two kinds of people

That's a deceitful woman
And a hard faced man

She took my man away
And ain't goin' bring him back

The shore was kissed
By sea and mist, tenderly
I can't forget
How two hearts met
Breathlessly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love

A little late arriving in my lonely world over here
For you have left me and where is our April [Incomprehensible] old?
You have left me and winter continues cold

A little slow reviving that music it made in my heart
Yes, time heals all things so I needn't cling to this fear
It's merely that spring will be a little late this year

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

That some poor girl has passed away
Don't shed a tear
If you should hear that gal was me

And if you see my picture in the papers with a smile on my face
I was broken hearted and that smile was out of place
So if you like to save a poor girl from her grave
Just find me a man if you can

I'm the lonesomest gal in town
Everybody has thrown me down
I ain't got no angel child to call me dear
Got no honey man for me to cuddle near

And I'm learnin' to roll my eyes
And some day you may be surprised
When I steal somebody's lovin' man
And kiss him with a smack
I'll hug him and I'll squeeze him
But I'll never give him back

It's a rocket to the moon
It gets you high, it gets you low
But once you get that glow

Here's to my best romance
Here's to my worst romance
Here's to my first romance, ages ago
Here's to the boys I've kissed
And to complete the list
Here's to the boys who said, ""No""

Love, love, hooray for love
Who was ever too blame for love
Make this the night for love
If we have to fight, let's fight for love

Some sigh and cry for love
Ah, but in Pa-ree they die for love
Some waste away for love
Just the same, hooray for love

It's the rocket to the moon
With a touch of â€~Clare de Lune'
It gets you high, it gets you low
But once you get that glow

Some trust to fate for love
Others have to take off weight for love
Some go berserk for love
Loafers even go to work for love

Sad songs are sobbed for love
People have their noses bobbed for love
Some say we pay for love
Just the same, hooray for love"
2191,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,I Concentrate On You (Alternate Take) ,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew
Whenever the winter winds become too strong
I concentrate on you

When fortune cries nay, nay to me
And people declare you through
Whenever the blues becomes my only song
I concentrate on you

On your smile, so sweet, so tender
When at first your kiss I decline
On the light in your eyes when I surrender
And once again our arms intertwine

And so when wise men say to me
That loves young dream never comes true
To prove that even wise men can be wrong
I concentrate on you"

Well sir, all I can say, is if I were a bell I'd be ringin'
From the moment we kissed tonight, that's the way I've just gotta behave
Boy, if I were a lamp I'd light or if I were a banner I'd wave

Ask me how do I feel, little me with my quiet upbringing
Well sir, all I can say is if gate I'd be swinging
And if I were a watch I'd start popping my springs
Or if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding

Yes, I knew my morale would crack
From the wonderful way that you looked
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked

Ask me how do I feel, ask me now that we're fondly caressing
Well, if I were a salad, I know I'd be splashing my dressing
Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring
Or if I were a gate, I would swing, have a fling almost any old thing
Or if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong ding dong ding dong ding ding dong"

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep

Their watch of wondering love

And praises sing to God, the King
And peace to men on earth"

Bells to be rung and a wonderful fling to be flung

And when the song birds that sing
Tell me it's spring
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong

I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same
Since we're apart

Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same
Never be the same again

When snow appears
It's not the Christmas card
You've sent for years

Not the joyful sound
When sleigh bells ring
Or the merry songs
Children sing

On Christmas day
Will not bring back the friend
You've turned away

So may I suggest, the secret of Christmas
It's not the things you do
At Christmas time but the Christmas things you do
All year through"

The stars are aglow
And tonight how their light sets me dreaming
My love, do you know
That your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?

I bring you, and sing you
A moonlight serenade

Let us stray, till break of day
In love's valley of dreams
Just you and I, a summer sky

I'm through with love for a while
I'm through and yet
You have a fabulous smile, so if I forget

Remind me not to find you so attractive
Remind me that the world is full of men
When I start to miss you, to touch your hand to kiss you
Remind me to count to ten

I had a feeling when I met you
You'd drive me crazy if I'd let you
But all my efforts to forget you
Remind me I'm in love again

I get my heart, well, in hand
And I'm certain that I can take you or leave you alone
Then you begin that beguine again and boom
I give in again, I have a will made of steel, my friend
But when it seems about to bend

Remind me not to mention that I love you
Remind me to be sorry that we met
Although I adore you remind me to ignore you
You're one thing I will regret

So when your charm begins to blind me
I'll simply tie my hands behind me
Don't let me kiss you please, remind me
Unless my darling, you forget"

My arms grow cold aching for you
No one can take your place
Darling, in my embrace, I'll never be free

And when my lips burn with desire
No other kiss puts out the fire
Though I may try and try, no one can satisfy
This longing in me

I'll never be free from your smile so tender
The sweet surrender in your eyes
How can I be free when I still remember
How you could thrill me with a sigh?

Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss I gave to you, made me
A slave to you, I'll never be free

Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

No armored knight out of a book
Would find a more enchanted Loralie then I

After reaching so long for a star

2214,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,"Let It Snow, Let It Snow ","Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"

And took my heart away
So from today

No one to see
I'm free as the breeze
No one but me
And my memories

Some lucky night
He may come back again
But until then
I'm trav'lin' light

No one to see
I'm free as the breeze
No one but me

Some lucky night
He may come back again

When I was someone in distress
A heart in search of happiness
You showed me the way

My sky was so gray
I never knew I'd feel a thrill
I couldn't dream a dream until
You showed me the way

The moment you found me
The shadows around me
Just disappeard from view
The world became rosy
Each corner so 'cozy
Darling, all because of you
You showed me the way

And if I've learned that love can be a paradise
For you and me
Here's all I can say
You showed me the way"

And I hear you speak my name
Softly in my ear

Lover, when we're dancing
Keep on glancing in my eyes
Till love's own entrancing
Music dies

All of my future is in you
Your every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender
When you're tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender
To my heart

Lover, it's immoral
But why quarrel with our bliss
When two lips of coral
Want to kiss

I say the devil is in you
And to resist you, I try
But if you didn't continue
I would die

Lover, please be tender
When you're tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender
To my heart"

In a hut for two
Two rooms and kitchen

Aglow with its cool evening light
But shining at night in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright

The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand
That shining at night in Tunisia
They guide you through the desert sand

Words fail to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told

In a world, ages old

The ending of day brings release
Each wonderful night in Tunisia
Where the nights are filled with peace

That out of sight is out of mind
Maybe that so but I tried to go
And leave you behind, what did I find?

I took a trip on the train and I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane and I thought about you
Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream

Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream
At every stop that we made, oh, I thought about you
But when I pulled down the shade, then I really felt blue

I peeked through the crack and looked at the track
The one going back to you, and what did I do?
I'll leave it to you, oh what did I do?
I thought about you"

I can't give you any more than honesty
I must read like an old love letter
Little girl, it's now or never

We've had some time to learn the rules
I'm so bad at wearing other peoples shoes
I really thought that we could be together
And that's why, its now or never, it's now or never

And like a candle burning
Both ends are melted all through
My hourglass is turning
I can't live this life without you

And I don't care if they say
I'm off my head
'Cause baby when it's now or never
It's now or never

We both know, you called my phone to speak
But I was freakin' so I turned the other cheek
I know now I was less than clever
Little girl, it's now or never

If you could read my troubled mind
If only you could feel my heart beat overtime
I'd make it known on this earth forever
I want you and it's now or never, it's now or never

And like a candle burning
Both ends are melted all through
My hourglass is turning
I can't live this life without you

And I don't care if they say
I'm off my head

Why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-nighting

Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel, I'm home

It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

Autumn in New York
The gleaming rooftops at sundown
Oh, autumn in New York
It lifts you up when you run down

Yes, jaded rou's and gay divorces
Whoo, lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's divine

This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Oh, autumn in New York
You'll need no castles in Spain

Yes, lovers that bless the dark
On the benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

Autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands
Its autumn in New York
Its good to live it again"

No hide away, no softly guitars

You led my heart astray
â€~Twas just a real sweet chance
To learn romance in a perfect way
It was the end of a perfect day

Say the moon was all aglow and Heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies
The stars all seemed to know
That you didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me, those little white lies

I try but there's no forgetting when evening appears
I sigh but there's no regretting in spite of my tears
The Devil was in your heart but Heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies"

The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard

I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore

Then, suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore

You smile and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart

Suddenly, the setting is strange

Someone said, as we shook hands
He was just Sir Jones to me

Then I tumble out of paradise

Darn that one track mind of mine

I want something to live for
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for
Someone who'd take my life and make it seem gay
As they say it ought to be

Searching the prom nights, seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my something to live for
I want something to live for"

Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no because I insist

Somewhere, somehow
Someone's gonna be kissed

So En Garde who knows what the fates have in store
From their vast mysterious sky?
I'll try hard ignoring those lips I adore
But how long can anyone try?

Chances are some heavenly star spangled night

The starless night, were not in vain

To fear together

Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown
If we're alone together"

There goes a big one, that one is mine
Catch up the reel now, I've got the feel now
Hooked onto my fly rod, I've got me a trout

Sweet talking liar, you're in for a fall

As he walks down the street folks will say

What a smile and how he shows it
He'll keep happy all day long
What a name, I bet he knows it
With that handle how can he go wrong?

And the folks in the town all agree
He'll be famous, as famous as he can be
How can he be a dud or a stick in the mud

A love to last, past Saturday night
I'd like to know, it's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love

I want a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody to care
I'm on a lonely road that leads to nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love

I do all my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

My arms need someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Monday's are cold
A love for all my life to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love

I do my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day

A love for all my life to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love

I asked the Lord above please send me someone to love
A special Sunday kind of love"

And the couples we know are fondly kissing
Will I be with you or will I be among the missing?

Maybe it's much too early in the game
Ah, but I thought I'd ask you just the same
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's eve?

Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night
Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve

Maybe I'm crazy to suppose
I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you received

Ah, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
Oh, what are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?"

The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And darling I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake, I awake and with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine

Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in, day out

Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt

He's got a million kinds of stardust
Pick your favorite brand

And dream, when you're feeling blue
Dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

Dream when the day is through
Dream and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream, dream
So dream, dream, dream"

Just another man
Doing what he can
But what does she care
When a woman loves a man

She'll just string along
All through thick and thin
Till his ship comes in
It's always that way
When a woman loves a man

She'll be the first one to praise him when he's goin' strong
The last one to blame him when every thing's wrong
It's such a one-sided game that they play
Ah, but women are funny that way

Tell her, she's a fool
She'll say, ""Yes, I know
But I love him so""
And that's how it goes
When a woman loves a man

Tell her, she's a fool
She'll say, ""Yes, I know
But I love him so""
And that's how it goes
When a woman loves a man"

Come to me in my reverie

Come on get off that shelf
You can fool some of the people some of the time
But you can't fool all the people all of the time

That's why I betcha a nickel that you will be mine

You can fool some of the people some of the time
But you can't fool all the people all of the time

Where you can smoke you pipe away
With my wee head upon you knee

Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though he's some other place, his face I see

At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my boy is there

It his prince who walks
Into my dreams and talks

He dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
There's my love
Up above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love

While the band is swinging

And stomping with you at the Savoy
What joy, a perfect holiday

Born a king on Bethlehem's plain

Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light"

Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married ?"" We'll say, ""No man
But you can do the job when you're in town""

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Elevator starts its ride

And down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf that's
Caught in the tide

I should stay away
But what can I do
I hear your name
And I'm aflame

Aflame with
Such a burning desire
That only your kiss
Can put out the fire

For you're the lover
I've waited for
The mate that fate
Had me created for
And every time
Your lips meet mine

Darling, down and down I go
Round and round I go
In a spin, I'm loving the spin
That I'm in
Under that old black magic
Called love

I should stay away
But what can I do
I hear your name
And I'm aflame

Aflame with
Such a burning desire
That only your kiss
Can put out the fire

For you're the lover
You're the lover, I have waited for
The mate that fate
Had me created for
And every time
Your lips meet mine

Darling, down and down I go
Round and round I go
In a spin, loving the spin
I'm in
I'm under that o-o-old black magic
Called love

Under that o-o-old black magic
Called love
Under that o-o-old black magic
Called love

Got me spinning and spinning
And spinning around
Like an elevator going down
And that old black magic called love"

All by myself, alone
Get you and keep you in my arms evermore
Leave all your lovelies weeping on the far away shore

Out on the briny with a moon big and shiny
Melting your heart of stone
I'd like to get you on a slow boat to China
All to myself, alone

All to myself alone
Leave all your lovelies
Weeping on the far away shore

Out on the briny with a moon big and shiny
Melting your heart of stone

All to myself alone"

For when my chin is on the ground
I pick myself up, dust myself off
And start all over again

Don't lose your confidence if you slip
Be grateful for a pleasant trip
And pick yourself up, dust yourself off
Start all over again

Work like a soul inspired
Till the battle of the day is won

But you'll be a man, my son

Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again?
So, take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off
Start all over again

Work like a soul inspired
Till the battle of the day is won

Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off
And start right over again"

But all I ever get from you is naggin' and braggin'

2283,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,I'll Be Hard to Handle ,"Now we'll say till something do us part
That old dad of mine ain't got a heart
Any girl who's out for pleasure
Thinks of marriage only at her leisure
As it is, they've got the horse behind the cart

When my pop said we must wed
He kind of wowed me, still I'm ready
But one thing must be clear at this time

I'll be hard to handle, I promise you that
And if you complain here's one little Jane
Who'll leave you flat

I'll be hard to handle, what else can I be
I say with a shrug, I think you're a mug
To marry me

When you first threw me a gander, I was willing to philander
But I never thought I'd have to be a bride
Now you're gonna find tough sledding
I don't want no shotgun wedding, I was only along for the ride

I'll be hard to handle, I'm telling you plain
Just be a dear and scram out of here
I'm gonna raise Cain

I'll be hard to handle, my bridges are burned
This wedding's a gag and you're in the bag
Where I'm concerned

I'll be hard to handle, when we've said, ""I do""
See there's no hope I just got a dope
When I took you

I'll be living my life in bed but they always will be twin beds
And I warn you, you'll be living like a monk
Our affair is now a past one, so don't think you've pulled the fast one
Just remember, I think you're a punk

I'll be hard to handle, I'm no ball and chain
I'll find some means to call the marines
I'm gonna raise Cain, gonna raise Cain
I'm telling you plain, I'm gonna raise Cain"

You're blowin' me no good, no good
Go ill wind, go away, skies are oh, so gray
Around my neighborhood and that's no good

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'

From out of nowhere, when loves to blame

So ill wind, blow away, find my love today
You're blowin' me no good, no good, no good"

How my thoughts go flashing back again to my old flame
My old flame, my new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent so magnificent or elegant as my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
I can't even think of his name but I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became of my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways

The moment that you go away
There is no night, there is no day

The world stops turning, the clock stops ticking
Everything stops but that flame in my heart
That keeps burning, burning

Oh, there's a lull in my life
No matter how I may pretend
I know that you alone can end
The ache in my heart, the call of my arms

I know that you alone can end
The ache in my heart, the call of my arms
And the lull, lull in my life"

Saxes do their tricks in Duke's Place

Fellas swing their chicks in Duke's Place
Come on! Get your kicks in Duke's Place
You find yourself a seat, and when you want to eat
You look around and yell, waiter

You fill your cup chock full of dreams and drink it up
You're jetting along with your girlie

Take your tootsies into Duke's Place
Life is in a spin in Duke's Place"

Somewhere a sweet lullaby tune

Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were
Meant to be more
Than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music
Until you return some day

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were
Meant to be more

Like a flower crying for the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh, how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh, how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss"

And you look at me adoringly
But as things stand
This time the dream's on me

To see you through, till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true, but this time the dream's on me

No love thoughts worried or distracted me
My disposition kept exempting me
Until you started in preempting me

And all this while
You've really been tempting me
Maybe you can tell me
What we ought to do

Now that you've got me going
What you gonna do?
Is it up to me, is it up to you?
What kind of game is this we've begun?
Was it done, just for fun?

We have necked, till I'm wrecked
Won't you tell me what you expect?
Is this to be a case of kiss and never tell?
Folly and farewell, heaven or maybe hell
Which is it going to be, love or gin?
Wife or sin? Let's begin

And I can't tell you why
There ain't no reason why I should love that man
It must be somethin' that the angels did plan

The chimney's smokin', the roof is leakin' in
But he don't seem to care
He can be happy with just a sip of gin
I even love him when his kisses got gin

Fish got to swim and birds got to fly
I got to love one man till I die
Can't help lovin' that man of mine

Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow
Tell me I'm crazy, maybe I know
Can't help lovin' that man of mine

When he goes away, that's a rainy day
And when he comes back that day is fine
The sun will shine

He can come home as late as can be
Home without him ain't no home to me
Can't help lovin' that man of mine"

You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeare Sonnet
You're Mickey Mouse

You're the Nile, you're the Tow'r of Pisa
You're the smile, on the Mona Lisa
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop
But if baby, I'm the bottom
You're the top

You're the top, you're Mahatma Gandhi
You're the top, you're Napoleon brandy
You're the purple light, of a summer night in Spain
You're the National Gallery, you're Garbo's salary
You're cellophane

You're sublime, you're a Turkey dinner
You're the time, of the Derby Winner
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop
But if baby, I'm by the bottom
You're the top"

Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it
Think of Siamese twins

Some Argentines without means, do it
People say in Boston, even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Romantic sponges they say, do it
Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Cold Cape Cod clams, against their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish, do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Electric eels I might add, do it
Though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it?
Waiter, bring me 'shad roe'

In shallow shoals, English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The chimpanzees in the zoos do it
Some courageous kangaroos do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

I'm sure giraffes on the sly do it
Heavy hippopotamii do it
Ooh, let's do it, let's fall in love

Old clogs who hang down from twigs, do it
Though the effort is great
Sweet Guinea pigs do it
Buy a couple and weigh it

The world admits, bears in pits do it
Even Pekingeses in the Ritz do it
Let's do it, let's just fall in love

That's why birds do it

The dragon flies in the reet do it
Sentimental centipedes do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Mosquitoes, heaven forbid

In shallow shoals

In shallow shoals, English soles, do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls, do it
Let's do it, let's fall"

You've no, enthusiasm
You're tired and uninspired
You're blase

Your day is one of leisure
In which you search for pleasure
You're bored when you're adored
You're blase

While reaching for the moon
And the stars up in the sky
The simple things of normal life
Are slowly passing by

You sleep, the sun is shining
You wake, its time for dining
There's nothing new for you to do
You're blase

While reaching for the moon
And the stars up in the sky
The simple things of normal life
Are slowly passing by

You're blase

She didn't say stay, she didn't say go
She only knew that he had spied her there
And then she knew he sat beside her there

At first there was heard not one little word
Then coyly she took one sly little look
And something awoke and smiled inside
Her heart began beating wild inside

So what did she do?
I leave it to you
She did just what you'd do too

She didn't say yes, she didn't say no
They very soon stood beside his chateau
They lingered like two poor waifs outside
For well she knew it was only safe outside

And there it was warm, out there it was cold
The sleet and the storm said, ""Better be bold""
She murmured, ""I'm not afraid of ice""
I only wish that I was made of ice

So what did she do?
I leave it to you
She did just what you'd do too

She didn't say yes, she didn't say no
She wanted to stay, but knew she should go
She wasn't so sure that he'd be good
She wasn't even sure that she'd be good

She wanted to rest all cuddled and pressed
A palpable part of somebody's heart
She'd love to be on rapport with him
But not behind a bolted door with him

And what did she do?
I leave it to you
She did just what you'd do too

She didn't say yes, she didn't say no
For heaven was near she wanted it so
Above her sweet love was beckoning
And yet she knew there'd be a reckoning

She wanted to climb but dreaded to fall
So bide her time and clung to the wall
She wanted to act ad-libitum
But feared to lose her equilibrium

So what did she do?
I leave it to you
She did just what you'd do too"

Why was I born?
Why am I living?
What do I get?
What am I giving?

Why do I want a thing

Why do I try
To draw you near me?
Why do I do I cry?

So drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feelin' so bad
I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad

Could tell you a lot
But you've gotta' be true to your code

Make it one, one for my baby
And one more for the road

You'd never know it
But buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things to say

And when I'm gloomy
You simply gotta listen to me
Until it's all talked away

Well, that's how it goes
And Joe I know you're gettin' anxious to close
So thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear

I'll be waiting for you darlin', underneath the apple tree

It's a pity to say goodnight because I want you to hold me tight
But if you gotta go home, you gotta go home, give me a goodnight kiss

How's about tomorrow night, just you and me
I'll be waiting for you darlin', underneath the apple tree

It's a pity to say goodnight because I want you to hold me tight

You gotta go home, you gotta go home, give me a goodnight kiss"

Asks me out for something wet
When the vet begins to pet, I cry Hooray

By a big tycoon in steel
If the meal includes a deal, accept I may

But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way

There's an oil man known as Tex
Who is keen to give me checks
And his checks, I fear, means that Tex is here to stay

But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way

From Ohio Mister Thorn
Calls me up from night till morn
Mister Thorn once cornered corn and that ain't hay

But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way

From Milwaukee Mister Fritz
Often dines me at the Ritz
Mister Fritz invented schlitz and schlitz must pay

But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way

Mister Harris, plutocrat
Wants to give my cheek a pat
If the Harris pat means a Paris hat, pay, pay!

Wildest box in town is Duke's Place

Saxes do their tricks in Duke's Place
Fellas swing their chicks in Duke's Place
Come on, get your kicks in Duke's Place

You find yourself a seat, and when you want to eat
You look around and yell, â€½Waiterâ€
You fill your cup chock full of dreams and drink it up
You're jetting along with your girlie

It's after three o'clock, but baby, it's early
If you've never been to Duke's Place
Take your tootsies into Duke's Place
Life is in a spin in Duke's Place

Ain't comin' home, no more

Supper time, kids will soon be yellin'
For their supper time
How'll I keep from tellin'
Them that man o' mine
Ain't comin' home, no more?

How'll I keep explainin'
When they ask me
Where, where he's gone?
How'll I keep from cryin'
When I bring their supper on?

How can I remind them to pray
At their humble board?
How can I be thankful when they
Start to thank the Lord, Lord

Those leftover dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day

Here's that rainy day
They told me about
And I laughed at the thought
That it may turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish
That I threw aside
After my lover was so near

Funny how love becomes
A cold rainy day
And funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes
A cold rainy day
And funny, that rainy day is here
That rainy day, that rainy day is here"

Walk with sticks or umbrellas
In their mitts

When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in Heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through

To Heaven, I'm in Heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Come on and dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through

To Heaven, I'm in Heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Out together dancing cheek to cheek
Out together dancing cheek to cheek"

And may all your Christmases be white

World can suddenly change
To a world as bright
As the evening star

Queer, what a difference
When your vision is clear
And you see things
As they really are

I used to be color blind
But I met you and now I find
There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon
There's blue in the skies

That semi-circle that was
Always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
You brought the colors out

Believe me it's really true
Till I met you I never knew
A setting sun could paint
Such beautiful skies

I never knew there were such lovely colors
And the big surprise
Is the red in your cheeks
The gold in your hair
The blue in your eyes

I never knew there were such lovely colors
And the big surprise
Is the red in your cheeks
The gold in your hair
The blue in your eyes

I used to be color blind"

But I have to keep guessing
How you feel about me

You listen to the words that I speak
But I feel that you listen
With your tongue in your cheek

You're laughing at me
I can't be sentimental
For you're laughing at me I know

I want to be romantic but I haven't a chance
You've got a sense of humor
And humor is death to romance

You're laughing at me
Why do you think it's funny
When I say that I love you so?

You've got me worried and I'm all at sea

You and the song are gone

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on

There 'neath the light of the moon

Told in all it's glory
Now that we have met

Is waiting to unfold

Now it can be told

Every other tale
Of boy meets girl
Is just an imitation

The great love story
Has never been told before

My cares upon the shelf because I find myself with

No strings and no connections, no ties to my affections
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy
No dates that can't be broken, no words that can't be spoken
Especially when I am feeling romancy

Like a robin upon a tree, like a sailor that goes to sea
Like an unwritten melody, I'm free, that's me
So bring on the big attraction, my decks are cleared for action
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy

As you listen to them play don't you get a glow?
If you step out on the floor you'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance, you'll forget your woe

So come, get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come, hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?
Let yourself go

Let yourself go, relax
And let yourself go, relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot

So come, cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer, ""No, sir""
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
Let yourself go

Let yourself go, relax
And let yourself go, relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot

So near and yet so far from me
And here am I on a night in June

Reaching for the moon and you

I'm just the words looking for the tune
Reaching for the moon and you"

How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?
How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel to be where you are?
How far is the journey from here to a star?
And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?"

Seem to be having their way
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day

The turn in the weather will keep us together
So I can honestly say that
As far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day and everything's okay

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way now you've got to remain
Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me

I can see the sun up high though we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm
Let the rain pitter patter but it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me

I can see the sun up high though we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm
Let the rain pitter patter but it really doesn't matter
If the skies, skies are gray long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day

A puppy dog at play, my heart is filled with envy
That's because my heart is yearning to pass the time away
Like that pup 'cause I'm all fed up and tho' it's wrong to be
I long to be

Lazy, I want to be lazy
I want to be out in the sun
With no work to be done

Under that awning, they call the sky
Stretching and yawning and let the world go drifting by
I want to peep through the deep, tangled wildwood
Counting sheep 'til I sleep like a child would

With a great big valise full of books to read
Where it's peaceful while I'm killing time
Being lazy

Life is short and getting shorter
With each day that goes by and how the time does fly
Before you know, it's over

That's why I'm in such a hurry to pack my things and fly
To a spot where it's nice and hot and hear the birdies sing
While I'm being"

Let's go slumming on Park Avenue
Let us hide behind a pair of fancy glasses
And make faces when a member of the classes passes

Let's go smelling where they're dwelling
Sniffing everything the way they do
Let us go to it, they do it, why can't we do it too?
Let's go slumming, nose thumbing at Park Avenue

Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingue traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong, again I was wrong

Life is lonely again and only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again a trough full of hearts could only be a bore
A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain
Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too"

The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more?

But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything from
The five and ten cent store

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne

Or stand on my head or anything
Don't think that I've lost my senses
It's just that my happiness finally commences
The long long ages of dull despair
Are turning into thin air
And it seems that suddenly i've
Become the happiest girl alive

Things are looking up
I've been looking the landscape over
And it's covered with 4 leaf clover
Oh things are looking up
Since love looked up at me
Bitter was my cup
But no more will I be the mourner
For I've certainly turned the corner
Oh things are looking up
Since love looked up at me

See the sunbeams
Every one beams
Just because of you
Love's in session
And my depression
Is unmistakably through
Things are looking up
It's a great little world we live in
Oh I'm happy as a pup
Since love looked up at me

We'll save our fares

I've a cozy little flat in
What is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancy Street you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow to and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with
Mott Street in July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the whiles
And starve together dear, in Chiles

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney on a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole, soul to soul

And 'My Fair Lady'
Is a terrific show they say
We both may see it close
Some day

The city's glamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy"

The clouds were like an alabaster palace, rising to a snowy height
Each star its own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight
I could see the midnight sun

I can't explain the silver rain that found me or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me, suddenly the sky turned pale
I could see the midnight sun

Was there such a night, it's a thrill I still don't quite believe
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember and the stars forget to shine
And we may see the meadow in December, icy white and crystalline
But oh, my darling always I'll remember when your lips were close to mine
And we saw the midnight sun"

Yes, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade

Mama, mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Money, you've got lots of friends
Crowding 'round the door
When you're gone and spending ends
They don't come no more

Rich relations give crust of bread and such
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But don't take too much

Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Rich, rich, rich relations give
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself

And travel each bend in the road

Are so hypnotized by the lovely

Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark

The moment you had touched my heart
And with you went my dream
All too soon

All too sweet, was our affair
And you put all the sweetness there
What a shame that it's gone
All too soon

I knew the strange delights
That only you in love could bring
But as I reached the heights
I realize the bottom fell from everything

You should know as well as I
Our love deserves another try
For your whispered goodbye
All too soon

Threw my heart away each spring
Now a spring romance hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter
All I've got to show's a splinter for my little fling

Spring this year has got me feeling
Like a horse that never left the post
I lie in my room staring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning's kiss wakes trees and flowers
And to them I'd like to drink a toast
I walk in the park just to kill lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon those birds twitter twit
I know the tune, ""This is love, this is it""
Heard it before and I know the score
And I've decided that spring is a bore

Love seemed sure around the New Year
Now it's April, love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time, only what became of you, dear?
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here, there's no mistaking
Robins building nests from coast to coast
My heart tries to sing so they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are writing sonnets
In the tender passion they're engrossed
But I'm on the shelf with last years Easter bonnets
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way, I hope it would last
We had our day, now that's all in the past
Spring came along a season of son
Full of sweet promise but something went wrong

Doctors once prescribed a tonic
""Sulphur and molasses"" was the dose
Didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Old man winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most"

All my life I was keeping
And was saving only for you

Yes, this love I was saving for you
My love I was keeping for you
A love no one else had before
You could never ask me for more

It was your love that I found
And after I give this to you
There will be no more love around
And after I give this to you
There will be no more love

Yes, there'll be no more love to be had
The world will be certainly sad
Without love it may even die
And then you'll discover that I
Was living just so you could see

You have all the love in the world
That I got for you and for me
You have all the love in the world
That I got for you and for me

Yes, now I know that my love
All my life I was keeping
And was saving only for you

2348,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,We'll Be Together Again ,"No tears, no fears
Remember there's always tomorrow
So what if we have to part
We'll be together again

Your kiss, your smile
Are memories I'll treasure forever
So try thinking with your heart
We'll be together again

Times when I know you'll be lonesome
Times when I know you'll be sad
Don't let temptation surround you
Don't let the blues make you bad

Someday, someway
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not goodbye
We'll be together again

Don't let temptation surround you
Don't let the blues make you bad

Someday, someway
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not goodbye
We'll be together again, we'll be together again"

Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree

'Cause you have so much on the ball, ah, you hit the spot
Like the first embrace with a modest tide
Well, you hit the spot

Like pipe and slippers by the fireside
Matter of factly, don't know exactly
What it is that you've got
But you hit the spot, you hit the spot

Like a balmy breeze on a night in May
You hit the spot
Like a cool mint julep on a sunny day
You hit the spot in my estimation"
2351,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Jingle Bells ,"Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, O
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, O
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, O
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead"
2352,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Sing My Heart ,"Go on and sing, my heart
You know it's spring, my heart
So why not show it?

Pretend you're glad, my heart
Although you're sad, my heart
He mustn't know it

Remember, love is not an easy game
No two hearts ever beat quite the same

Go on and dance, my heart
Our only chance, my heart
Is to forget it

Should you despair, my heart
He'll know we care, my heart
And we'll regret it

If it's to be, we soon shall see and if it's not to be
No power on earth can make it so

Pretend it's spring, my heart
Go on and sing my heart
For if you sing, he'll never know

Go on and dance, my heart
Our only chance, my heart
Is to forget it

Should you despair, my heart
He'll know we care, my heart
And we'll regret it

If it's to be, we soon shall see and if it's not to be
No power on earth can make it so

Pretend it's spring, my heart
Go on and sing, my heart
For if you sing, he'll never know"
2353,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Imagine My Frustration ,"I went down to the dance
Sat down by the wall
Invited to dance
By no one at all

The couples danced fine
So charming an' gay
But nobody wants
Look over my way

So awfully sad
Dissatisfied
And hurt so bad
I almost cried

Imagine my frustration
With no invitation to dance

Head high, standing tall
Who else, who else could I be?
But Ella, the woman and above
Who likes what they see?

And then in my ear
Someone said to me
Wallflower, my dear
How come you cannot see

They couldn't care less
They're not impressed
As you might guessed
You're in excess

Imagine my frustration
With no invitation to dance

I smiled to the crowd
Tip toe and alert
Yes the band blues went loud
But next on a flirt

A voice said to me
Wallflower, my dear
You're sweet as can be
But how come you're here

They couldn't care less
About your dress
You're in a mess
And in excess

Imagine my frustration
With no invitation to dance"
2354,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Heart of Mine ,"I can't believe you really love me
That I can call the sun to shine
I'm so afraid there'll be another after me
Heart of mine

And yet when I receive your letters
I'm reassured by every line
I hope they still hold true, for me there's only you
Heart of mine

Are you on the level?
Do you tell me lies?
I'm between the devil
And your deep blue haunting eyes

I love you, so I'd hate to lose you
To me you're something really fine
Don't ever change of heart, say, we'll never part
Heart of mine"
2355,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,The Real American Folk Song (1959 Stereo Version) ,"Near Barcelona, the peasant crooned
The old traditional Spanish tunes
The Neapolitan street song sighs
You think of Italian skys

Each nation has a creative vein
Originating a native strain
With folk songs plaintive and others gay
In their own peculiar way

American folk songs I feel
Have a much stronger appeal

The real American folk song is a rag, a mental jag
A rhythmic tonic for the chronic blues
The critics called it a Joke Song, but now
They've changed their tune, and they like it, somehow
For it's inoculated with a syncopated sort of meter, sweeter
Than a classic strain, boy you can't remain, still or quiet, for it's a riot

The real American folk song is like a fountain of youth
You taste, and it elates you, and then, invigorates you
The real American folk song, the masses coaxed on, is a rag

The real American folk song is a rag, a mental jag
A rhythmic tonic for the chronic blues
The critics called it a Joke Song, but now

2356,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Airmail Special ,"Left New York this morning early
Traveling south, so wide and high
Sailing through the wide blue yonder
It's that Airmail Special on the fly

Listen to the motors humming
She is streaking through the sky
Like a bird that's flying homeward
It's that Airmail Special on the fly

Over plains and high dark mountains
Over rivers deep and wide
Carrying mail to California
It's that Airmail Special on the fly

Watch her circle for the landing
Hear her moan and cough and sigh
Now she's coming down the runway
It's that Airmail Special on the fly"
2357,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,The Gentleman Is a Dope ,"The gentleman is a dope, a man of many faults
A clumsy Joe who wouldn't know a Rumba from a Waltz
The gentleman is a dope and not my cup of tea
Why do I get in a dither? He doesn't belong to me

The gentleman isn't bright, he doesn't know the score
A cake will come, he'll take a crumb and never ask for more
The gentleman's eyes are blue but little do they see
Why am I beating my brains out? He doesn't belong to me

He's somebody else's problem, she's welcome to the guy
She'll never understand him half as well as I

The gentleman is a dope, he isn't very smart
He's just a lug you'd like to hug and hold against you heart
The gentleman is a dope doesn't know how happy he could
Look at me crying my eyes out, as if he belonged to me
He'll never belong to me

He's somebody else's problem, she's welcome, welcome to the guy
She'll never understand him half as well, well as I

The gentleman is a dope, he isn't very smart

But I'm not gonna holler 'cause I've still got a dollar
And when I get low, oh, I get high

My man walked out, now you know that ain't right
Well, he better watch out if I meet him tonight
I said when I get low, oh, I get high

All this hard luck in this town
Has found me
Nobody knows how troubles
All drown around me, oh

I'm all alone with no one to pet me
My old rocking chair ain't never gonna get me
â€~Cause when I get low, oh, I get high

When I get low, oh, I get high"
2359,Hip-Hop,Ella Fitzgerald,Miscellaneous ,Signing Off ,"Signing off, does it surprise you
I won't need your lips anymore
Signing off, can't idolize you
My heart crossed your name off the door

Signing off, now that I've told you
That this is just where I came in
Signing off, why should I hold you
You've already said I can't win

It's strange how the rest of the world knows
The things you should see at a glance
And I want what all of the world knows
A person to person romance

Signing off, I can't pretend dear
My trip to the stars took a spill
We're all through, this is the ending
Because you only wanted a thrill, I'm signing off

I'll always remember the pleasure
Of friendship and all that it's worth
I know that it's something to treasure
From here to the ends of the earth

Signing off, happy I met you
So please make me happy again
And be sure I won't forget you
The best of everything until then, I'm signing off

Signing off"

I got a guy
Doesn't have any money
But to me he's a honey
For he's mine and I think he's too divine

I got a guy
When he starts in to pet me
He can't thrill and upset me
He's the kind that you can't keep off you mind

I got a guy and he's tough
He's just a gem in the rough
But when I polish him up
I swear, he'll be a Tiffany solitaire

I'm riding high
And I'm happy and carefree
There is nothing can scare me
'Cause I got a guy

There is nothing can scare me

Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And fit us for heaven to live with Thee there"

That's your red wagon, that's your red wagon
So just keep dragging your red wagon along

Remember you'll do the lying there
When you buttered your bread
Don't expect me to eat your share!

Never noticed the rain
Till you came by

But now whenever you're away
Can't sleep nights and suffer all the day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder

But when you hold me tight
Tinglin' all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right
But I'm doing better than ever now

But now whenever you're away
Can't sleep nights and suffer all the day

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love, you won't regret it
That's the best work of all if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't passed
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London Town
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London Town
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere

For from history I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned

They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly
They told Marconi, wireless was a phony, it's the same old cry

They laughed at me, wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy

Always had my peace of mind
Kept old man trouble at a distance
My days were silver lined
Right on top of the world I sat
But look at me now, I don't know where I'm at

I was doing all right
Nothing but rainbows in my sky
I was doing all right
Till you came by

Had no cause to complain
Life was as sweet as apple pie
Never noticed the rain
Till you came by

But now whenever you're away
Can't sleep nights and suffer all the day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder

But when you hold me tight
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing alright
But I'm doing better than ever now

But now whenever you're away

You lift me to the skies, my heart flip flops
You shouldn't make it make like that

I'm still in love with you 'cause truth tell
You always kinda knew that we would gel
'Cause jam could never shake like that

But I knew you wouldn't quit
When I dug you and you hit me with that old time jive

And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, darling I love you
And we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me
(edward ""duke"" ellington, bob russell)


Do nothing till you hear from me,
Pay no attention to what's said.
Why people tear the seams of anyone's dreams
Is over my head.


Do nothing till you hear from me,
At least consider our romance.
If you should take the words of others you've heard,
I haven't a chance.


True, i've been seen with someone new,
But does that mean that i've been untrue?
When we're apart,
The words in my heart
Reveal how i feel about you.


Some kiss may cloud my memories,
And other arms may hold a thrill,
But please, do nothing till you hear it from me--
And you never will.

and whisper you'll be mine

Then suddenly shove duck
When she throws her hook out
Don't let your heart get took out
Pick up your pack and cook out
Oh look out, look out it's love

Look out where you're rowing
Stay close to the bank
That river is flowing
Right into a tank

Look out where you ramble
You're out on the loose
You're liable to amble
Ride into a noose

You better look out or better turn about
Like a trout
At the dam, scram, take it on the lamp
It's a jam, it's a stampede

She'll talk to her lawyer, where by and where of
She'll get the marriage book out
And she'll pick the perfect look out
Her welcome mask's been shook out
Oh look out, look out for love"

Ways to lose a tune
I don't take advice of no one
I know just what to do

I think you get what I mean

You give her lots of kisses
And dine her with good food
Work to keep her cheerful
And in a loving mood

I think you get what I mean
I think you get what I mean
Your chick is all that matters

There're times when she'll stay out late
And you'll be feeling blue
Go on out and have a ball, son
She'll come running back to you

Have yourself a ball
I think you get what I mean"

Then the rain begins to fall, pitter-patter, pitter-patter
Love is gone, what can matter
No sweet lover man comes to call

When Sunny gets blue, she breaths a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swaying
Like some violin is playing strange and haunting melodies

People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair, she lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same

But memories will fade and pretty dreams will rise up
Where her other dreams fell through
Hurry new love, hurry here, to kiss away each lonely tear
And hold her near when Sunny gets blue

People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name

But I don't want to see tomorrow

Tomorrow, so I hear
The clouds will disappear
The door to happiness will open wide
But I don't want to see tomorrow
Unless you're there by my side

Don't want to walk alone
Don't want to dream alone
Just want you close to my heart

For if your love is gone
How can I face the dawn of
Sunday, or Monday?
I just can't face one day

Until you say you're mine
Oh, darling, please be mine
And make each bright tomorrow young and new
But I don't want to face tomorrow

The end of the road

So love is a hoax
A glittering stream
Of little white lies

But these are the jokes
And what if they bring
The tears to your eyes?

Well, love often shows
A funny return
The brighter it glows
The longer you burn

And Lord only knows
Love has little concern
For the fools of the road

But that's how it goes

How eager you are to get to that star
But after the journey's through
You're only a lonely dreamer
Without someone to tell it to

There'll be blue days hard to get through days
Days when you'll just want to die
Soon you're older and the world's colder
When there's no shoulder to cry on

Castles in air are empty and bare
With no one to share the view
The moonlight is merely moonlight
There's no magic in, 'I love you'
Without someone someone to tell it to

The moonlight is merely moonlight
There's no magic in 'I love you'
Without someone someone to tell it to"

Still he sets a place for you, everything the way it was before

I keep goin' back to Joe's but the man who plays piano
Never plays your favorite melody
Joe keeps busy at the bar, never asks me where you are
He was there when you walked out on me

Now I pray you'll walk back in and you'll say what fools we've been
And we'll celebrate a happy new beginning
Chances are you'll never show but you'll know just where to find me
Every night until it's time to close

Just in case you miss me, too

To side of the street that's sunny

Can't you hear the pit-a-pat
The rat-a-tat, of the happy tunes in your step
Life can be so sweet
On side of the street that's sunny

I used to walk in the shade
With the blues on parade
I'm not afraid, 'cause my worries are over
And  the road's crossed over

If my number never comes out
We'll still be rich like Feller
And Constantine D'mello
Gold's at our feet
On side of the street that's sunny

How could he know, we two were so in love?
The whole darn world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

When dawn came stealing up, all gold and blue
To interrupt our rendezvous

As the dancing a feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away

I missed you, so I thought I'd die
But it's all over now, throw my hat in the sky

Something dear inside

To think they could doubt my love

When a lovely flame dies

I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy
I'm so ashamed of it but must admit
The sleepless nights I've had about the boy

On the silver screen
He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
Although I'm quite aware that here and there
Are traces of the cad, about the boy

Lord knows I'm not a fool girl
I really shouldn't care
Lord knows I'm not a school girl
In the fury of her first affair

Will it ever cloy
This odd diversity of misery and joy?
I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy

So if I could employ
A little magic that will finally destroy
This dream that pains me and enchains me
But I can't because I'm mad, I'm mad about the boy"

But there a guy sat, two stools away
And you could tell the bartender knew him

And that he'd been there some other day
And while I sipped my libation
I overheard his conversation

Remember, how I'd walk in
What excitement there would be?
Never less than twenty people
I had lots of friends, you see

I gave the party, I was the host
Everyone loved me, I was the most

Champagne and plenty of it
Real imported caviar
And the hatcheck girl got fifty
Just for lighting my cigar

I kept 'em laughin', jokes by the yard
Everyone loved me, I was a card

And I had a girl, a beautiful girl, her whole world
I think, consisted of mink and diamonds and pearls
Because she was mine, I'd glitter and shine,
And life was a ball, and wasn't it all, so cozy 'n fine?

But nothing lasts forever and the deepest well runs dry
Just 'cause I've stopped rolling sevens doesn't mean I have to cry
I'll take that nightcap, one more won't show
And incidentally maybe you know where, oh, where, oh, where
Did everyone go?

Where, oh, where, oh, where
Did everyone go?"

But once a year for every girl and boy

The wind blows memories through my hall

And blow their stupid little horns
At midnight they will all be singing, â€½Auld Lang Syneâ€½
But the sad ones sit alone before the fire and sip a glass of lonely wine

I wish you a Happy New Year darling
May your new love be bright and fair
I hope, he'll do those special things for you

I love the days we spent together
Before the old year lost its shine

In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have
Some fun down before I melt away""

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets
Of town right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""Stop""

But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry

You couldn't hurt me, could you?

The one who has my heart would also have my name"

With the moonlight above

Then I touch your hand
And next moment, I kiss you
Fascination turned to love"
2608,Hip-Hop,Nat King Cole,Miscellaneous ,Te Quiero Dijiste ,"Te quiero dijiste
Tomando mis manos
Entre tus manitas
De blanco marfil

Y sentÃ­ en mi pecho
Un fuerte latido
DespuÃ©s un suspiro
Y luego el chasquido
De un beso febril

MuÃ±equita linda
De cabellos de oro
Dos dientes de perla
Labios de rubÃ­

Dime si me quieres
Como yo te adoro
Si de mÃ­ te acuerdas
Como yo de ti

A veces escucho
Un eco divino
Que envuelto en la brisa
Parece decir

SÃ­ te quiero mucho
Mucho mucho mucho
Tanto como entonces
Siempre hasta morir"
2610,Hip-Hop,Nat King Cole,Miscellaneous ,This Is All I Ask ,"As I approach the prime of my life
I find I have the time of my life
Learning to enjoy at my leisure
All the simple pleasure
And so I happily concede

This is all I ask
This is all I need

Beautiful girls, walk a little slower when you walk by me
Lingering sunset, stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere, when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange enchanted land
Grownups seldom understand

Wandering rainbows, leave a bit of color for my heart to own
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true
Before the night has flown
And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing
Then I will stay younger than spring"
2611,Hip-Hop,Nat King Cole,Miscellaneous ,April In Paris ,"I never knew the charm of spring
I never met it face to face
I never new my heart could sing
I never missed a warm embrace

Till April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables under the trees
April in Paris, this is a feeling
That no one can ever reprise

I never knew the charm of spring
I never met it face to face
I never new my heart could sing
I never missed a warm embrace

Till April in Paris
Whom can I run to?
What have you done to my heart?"

Showing me what the world means
What I've been dreaming of
And now I know there is nothing that I could not do

Letting me know what's real
From what is not

Putting things in perspective
Teaching me how to give
And how to take

We were put here together
And if I breakdown
Forgive me but it's true

That I'm aching
With the love I feel inside
Thanks to you
Thanks to you"
2613,Hip-Hop,Nat King Cole,Miscellaneous ,Joe Turner Blues (Live) ,"This is a song was sung back
In eighteen and ninety two
There was a terrible flood that year
People lost everything they had

Their crops, their live stock
That means their horses, their mules, cows
Goats and everything they had on their farm

And they would start crying
And singing this song

They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Lord, they tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
They tell me, Joe turner been here and gone

Then they would go out hunting rabbits
'Coons and 'possums
Anything they could catch
Sometimes they would catch something
Then again they didn't

And when they would come home
They would find flour meat and molasses
In their homes and they would know that
Joe Turner had been there and left food for them

And they would start crying
And singing this song

They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Lord, they tell me, that Joe turner been here and gone
They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone

Then they would start out looking for wood
And stuff to make a fire
And they would look in their yards
And they would find axes, wood
That Joe Turner had brought there for them

Then they would get happy
And start singing and crying this song
They would get happy
And do a little boogie woogie too"

'Cause I want her, I'm gonna ask her

Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
Way you're acting lately makes me doubt
You is still my baby, baby
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

A woman is a creature that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of what you'll find
She's gone and made a change

Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true

How sublime it was too
I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand

Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand
Grand to be alive, to be young

To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was

Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise
And I know what time it is now

I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes, I'm wise
And I know what time it is now"

You laughed at Mr. Franklin with his key and kite
The point of the song is I'm always wrong
But with you baby, I'm oh so right"

It was a most convenient dorm
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store

The rain continued for an hour
I hang around for three or four
Around a million dollar baby
In a five an ten cent store

She was selling China
And when she made those eyes
I kept buying China
Until the crop got wise

Incidentally if you should run into a shower
Just step inside my cottage door
And meet the million dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store

Maybe that is why you love me so little
Maybe when I answered, yes
Maybe I became a bore
Maybe if I love you less

Maybe it's because I kissed you too much

Maybe with a love so great and a love so small
Maybe I'll be left with no love at all"

For fooling around with chicks
Because in that love department
I know all the ladies tricks

Now I ran across a girl one day
She was as sharp as a girl could be
And I wasn't surprised to hear her say
That she really went for me

She said I was the best man
Whoever knocked on her door
She said I was the best man
The fella she'd waited for

She said I was the best man
At dancing and nobody can deny
That when it came to romancing
I was the [unverified] number 1 guy

But then she met I best friend
And knocked him right off his pins
But still I wasn't worried
'Cause the best man always wins

The way it all turned out
There was no doubt
That I was best man in the end
Yes, I was the best man
When she married my best friend"
2622,Hip-Hop,Nat King Cole,Miscellaneous ,I Get A Kick Out Of You ,"My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything
Leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case

When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from Champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high
With some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do

Yet I get a kick out of you"

I'm at peace with the world once again
At the end of a long weary day we embrace
Once again I've the world in my arms

Just like a ship lost at sea
That's been tossed by the wind and the waves
I return to the haven I know will be there
And again I've the world in my arms

So press me close to the soul
And the heart of you love
By the beat of a heart that is true
I'm content though I know
That my worldly possessions are few

For in you I've a world full of love

Shows a wedding in June

Pure as gold and guaranteed

Let me tell you this

I found a new baby
A sweet honey boy
My fashion-plate baby
Has thrilled me with joy

His new way of lovin'
Has made me his slave
His sweet turtle dovin'
Is all that I crave

Sweetest kiss, what a kiss, full of bliss

I'm too high hat, you're too lowdown

They say that when a highbrow meets a lowbrow
Walking along Broadway
Soon the highbrow, he has no brow
Ain't it a shame, and you're to blame

What's the use of prohibition?
You produce the same condition
Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too"

There's a lonely Russian rose
Gazing tenderly down upon her knee

When baby starts to cry

Somewhere there may be
A land that's free for you and me
And a Russian lullaby"

So I didn't change my shirt
The evening's drinks
Left a lingering taste in my mouth

And when I left you were fast asleep
Tangled in the sheets
And on the bus I could have sworn it was all a dream
And it didn't happen to me

And then I felt the scrapes
From the slippery subway grate
Oh, how you laughed
At my complete lack of grace

But I could not recall
A more perfect fall
'Cause when I looked up into your eyes
It didn't hurt at all

And I thought, be still my heart
This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear
If I wake up and you're still here with me in the morning

My two front teeth, see my two front teeth
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth
Then I could wish you, ""Merry Christmas""

My soul has often found relief
And oft escaped the tempter's snare
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer
The joys I feel, the bliss I share
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for thy return

With such I hasten to the place
Where God my Savior shows His face
And gladly take my station there
And wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless

And since he bids me seek His face
Believe his word and trust His grace
I'll cast on Him my every care
And wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer"

Never ever have a nickel in my jeans
Never ever have a debt to pay
Still I understand what real contentment means
Guess I was born that way

Please plant this heart of mine
Underneath the lonesome pine on the hill

Day after day in the fields of yellow corn
No place on earth do I love more sincerely
Than old Virginny, the place where I was born

Carry me back to old Virginny
There let me live till I wither and decay
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered
There's where this old darky's life am passed away

Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more

When you took that exit bow
Someone you met has made you regret
So who's the smarty now?

Say, how does it feel

Wasn't so real
It was only a song and a dance?

Where is that boy
Who believed every word of this ridiculous tale?

Who was so childishly flattered?
Thought he'd swept her off her feet
Who woke to find his dream shattered?

For you needn't strain your eyes
To see what I want you to see

A telephone that rings and who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The 'Ile-de-France' with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is spring's

Silk stockings tossed aside, dance invitations

Wish someone would hold me tight

Every time she's close to me
My heart is filled with ecstasy

There, I should have told her then
But all I did was sit and grin
And I ended up so mad
That I could cry

2687,Hip-Hop,Nat King Cole,Miscellaneous ,Lonely One ,"There is a very quiet boy, they call the lonely one
There's sorrow in his face and sadness in his eyes
And if you look into the heart within the lonely one
You'll find it's been deceived by broken vows and lies

Is it good to have pride with a longing to hide
All your heartaches and fears?
Is it wise to be cold and to struggle to hold back the tears?
If you could only see the boy they call the lonely one
You'd know that since you're gone, the lonely one is me

Once I didn't have a kid
And no despair ever came to me
Now I'm blue and the trouble with me is you

Yes, I know I was alone and on my own
Still my heart was green and blue
And the trouble with me is you

You took a heart, took it apart
You took a dream, threw out the scene

You took the sun away, leavin' me a cloudy day

Our love affair wasn't meant to be
So I'm blue and the trouble with me is you

You took a heart, took it apart

And every time I play my ace, my partner always trumps
I guess, I'm just a fool, who never looks before he jumps
Everything happens to me

At first, my heart thought, you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end my despair
But now, I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

You answer was goodbye and there was even postage due
I fell in love just once and then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me"

Hey, little girl, you will always make up
So take off that unbecoming frown

What about me, well, I'll find someone

A nice little housewife who'll give me a steady life
And won't keep going off the rails

però, si sa lo fa.



Sto trafficando beato me

sotto un fruscio di taffetà

e mi domando in fondo se

mentre lei splende sul sofà

d´inverno, d´inverno

non sai anche più intelligente.



Si, si d´inverno è meglio

dopo è più facile dormire e andare

oltre i pensieri com un libro

Svanti in una nebbia o in una tappezzeria
Addio addio, mai pi ritorneranno, si sa
Col tempo e il vento tutto vola via
Tais-toi, tais-toi, tais-toi

Ma qualche volta cos
Che qualcuno tornato sotto certe carezze
E poi la strada inghiotte subito gli amanti
Per piazze e ponti ciascuno se ne va
E se vuoi, laggi li vedi ancora danzanti
Che pi che gente sembrano foulards

Ma tutto il meglio gi qui, non ci sono parole"

Un’ Altra Vita
Un’ altra vita per noi

oltre il basilico e le fragranza

e la sua barbarica baldanza,

un’ altra vita per noi

oltre il dialetto che hanno i santi,

arcano come certi amanti…

un’ altra vita verrà, e un’ altra vita sarà

oltre le lune e gli uragani e le tue mani

sopra le mie mani…



Quando il leone starà

ad aspettarti sulla tua strada

e mezzogiorno, ti guardi intorno…

neanche il Signore non c’è…

è seduto a pranzo con i suoi amici

e la sua bici non ti presterà…

Il corpo di lei mandava vampate africane, lui sembrava un coccodrillo
I saxes spingevano a fondo come ciclisti gregari in fuga
E la canzone andava avanti sempre piu' affondata nell'aria

Quei due continuavano, da lei saliva afrore di coloniali
Che giungevano a lui come da una di quelle drogherie di una volta
Che tenevano la porta aperta davanti alla primavera

Qualcuno nei paraggi incominciava a starnutire
Il ventilatore ronzava immenso dal soffitto esausto
I saxes, ipnotizzati dai movimenti di lei si spandevano
Rumori di gomma e di vernice, da lui di cuoio

Le luci saettavano sul volto pechinese della cassiera
Che fumava al mentolo, altri starnutivano senza malizia
E la canzone andave elegante, l'orchestra era partita, decollava
I musicisti, un tutt'uno col soffitto e il pavimento

Solo il batterista nell'ombra guardava con sguardi cattivi
Quei due danzavano bravi, una nuova cassiera sostituiva la prima
Questa qui aveva occhi da lupa e masticava caramelle alescane
Quella musica continuava, era una canzone che diceva e non diceva

L'orchestra si dondolava come un palmizio davanti a un mare venerato
Quei due sapevano a memoria dove volevano arrivare
Un quinto personaggio esito' prima di sternutire
Poi si rifugio' nel nulla, era un mondo adulto
Si sbagliava da professionisti"

Quali parole, luce di pioggia e luce di conquista

Han passo di ossessione

E sanno bene che lazzardo
Lieve come il leopardo
E san che tutte le figure

Uninquietudine e un grande inchino
Ero vicino a una citt lontana
Tutta di madreperla, argento

E non trovavo qui nessuno
Per parlarne un poco

E anche pi solo e finto

Fan di me un orango

Novecento
Dicono che quei cieli siano adatti
al cavalli e che le strade
siano polvere di palcoscenico
Dicono che nelle case donne pallide
sopra la vecchia «Singer» cuciano
gli spolverini di percalle,
abiti che contro il vento stiano tesi
e tutto il resto siano balle,
vecchio lavoro da cinesi… eh… eh…
Dicono che quella vecchia canzoncina
dell’ottocento fa sorridere
in un dolce sogno certe bambole
tutte trafitte da una freccia indiana,
ricordi del secolo prima, roba di un’epoca lontana,
epoca intravista nel bagliore bianco
che spara il lampo di magnesio
sul rosso folle del manganesio.. eh… eh…
Indacato era il silenzio e il Grande Spirito,
che rellentava la brina, scacciava
i corvi dalla collina…
come una vecchia cuoca in una cucina
sgrida i fantasmi del buongustai
in una lenta cantilena…
Lasciamo stare, lasciamo perdere, lasciamo andare
non lo sappiamo dov’eravamo
in quel mattino da vedere… eh… eh…
Dov’eravamo mai in quel mattino
quando correva il novecento
le grandi gare di mocassino…
lassù, sui palcoscenico pleistocenico,
sull’altopiano preistorico
prima vulcanico e poi galvanico…
dicono che sia tutta una vaniglia,
una grande battaglia,
una forte meraviglia… eh… eh…
Galvanizzato il vento spalancava
tutti i garages e liberava grossi motori entusiamati…
la paglia volteggiava nell’aria gialla
più su del regno delle aquile
dove l’aereo scintilla…
l’aereo scintillava come gli occhi
del ragazzi che, randagi,
lo guardavano tra i rami del ciliegi… eh…eh"

Vita da Sosia
In un angolo sperduto vivo là,
Campo così cosà…
Quando si è il sosia di qualcuno si ha
Molta curiosità
Di saperne qualcosa… e dunque scendo in città…

“Sorpresa ! El comandante està a quì !
Rapido, sirvale un vermuth, el
Comandante està a quì ! Curre
A scetà Morena cà duorme, iamme-ah !
Como una rosa, rosa, rosa y negra, và !”…
Anda !

Causa il buio dell’ appartamento i’
Nun puozzo valutà la supremazia è chella femmena
Nun puozzo realizzà la entità concreta
De lo que va pasar !

…Matalo, Matalo !

“Cumandà, tenite forma splendida” me habla
Chellallà, “tu sì matator e pure arcangelo,
Brutal y espiritual ! Busco en mi repertorio
Un numero especial…”

… …Esta es España…
Una casa de tolerancia…
Non digo lo que me toco’ pasar, la noche
Mas tribolante… es mejor todo olvidar…
Ah, vida de sosia, vida ! Che guai aggi’ a

Avvenne per caso in una
Stradina moderna sotto la pioggia
Gli ombrelli che fanno zum -zum - zum
E l’ universo fa bum - bum - bum

Lui: una canzone francese
Lei: una rossa risata irlandese
Piovvero languidi giorni

Sì ma io dov’ero andato
Tutto mi sarei guardato
E ne avrei scritto anche meglio di così

Lui era un loden portato da una
Dolcezza senza rimpianti
Da studi classici ardenti,
La pipa morsa tra i denti…

Lei era un cavallo, un gatto, un’ondata
Di mare nordico al sole,
Vestita come uno vuole,
Vestita come uno vuole…
(…)

Due belle gambe, lei e un po’ di
Fumo azzurro, lui…
Col permesso degli dei…

Gli dei dei bei sonni…
Gli dei dei begli anni,
Gli dei dell’ amore rosso,
Del fuoco nelle sottane, architetture lontane…

Ti chiami Ines, ma adesso il
Nome che porti è Judith…
Forse un uomo in un atimo di
Confusione e lacrime, o tu stessa
Per dare una svolta alla vita
E ai segreti, sì, hai scelto “Judith”.
Judith sì, sì…

Guidavo piano quel giorno
Sull’ otto volante dei secoli, dei
Millenni, del freddo, del fuoco,
Del vento degli attimi,
La città sottostante era tutta
Una casbah di baratri, lo specchio
Dei miraggi “amore, amor” …

Oggi ho carcato il tuo cuore al
Telefono, non hai risposto tu…
Era Ines, da molto lontano, un
Lontano intoccabile…
Era estate, ho sentito l’inverno
Arrivare dagli angoli, da tutti i
Mille spifferi del nord…

Roba Di Amilcare
Dal lungomare di qualche paese francese
trafiggendo con gli occhi gli azzurri
guardava laggiù
I’ho visto, guardava a sinistra una nebbia velata
l'ho visto, guardava Sanremo lontana e italiana

Con sotto le scarpe silenzi di alta montagna
e dietro le spalle guizzanti chitarre di Spagna
silenzio, bambino, stà zitto non ridere o piangere
Stà bravo, bambino, che qui sto parlando di Amilcare.

Con lui c'era Bigi, i lunghi capelli suoi candidi
lisciati dal vento come onde atlantiche, elastiche,
con l'aria di due che hanno trovato qualcosa,
volevo abbracciarli ma non mi veniva una scusa

poi in quel confuso viavai come in un'autopista
mi sono sfuggiti e di colpo li ho persi di vista
stà zitto, bambino, silenzio non piangere o ridere
stà bravo, bambino, che qui parlo sempre di Amilcare.

Andavo a caccia di artisti anche menefreghisti,
artisti comunque, artisti ovunque e comunque,
un po’ meglio di questi poeti di oggi qualunque
aedi del vuoto invocato e non mai esplorato.

Cercavano uno per farsi contare una storia
che fosse inventata o infuocata da antica memoria

che questa qui, vedi, bambino e roba di Amilcare."

But I'm not done with the night

So I stayed up and read
But your words in my head
Got me mixed up so I turned out the light

And I, don't know how
To slow it down
My mind's racing
From chasing pirates

Well, I'm having the squeems
While the silliest thing's
Floppin' around in my brain

And I try not to dream
But them possible schemes
Swim around, wanna drown me in sync

And I don't know how
To slow it down
Oh, my mind's racing

But now there is nothing else in my head
And though it's strong I wish he'd leave me alone
I wish he'd leave me

But I have to go, I have to go

'Cause I know trouble will follow

Shotgun wedding in a strange SoHo
Our chambers hold silvery collars
Gun down werewolves wherever we go
We gun down werewolves wherever we go

Midnight phone calls in the back of a Mustang
Creased white pages torn right from the spine
Kissed my neck with a crooked, cracked fang
You always hoped one day you'd be mine

Threw our fathers on funeral pyres
I'm not sure we were playing a game
Busted gasket in a field full of liars
No one noticed we set five boroughs aflame
No one noticed we set five boroughs aflame

Old ghosts go home

Band of gold with a diamond implied
You wrote letters that you never sent
I made promises I'll always deny
Now we'll never know what the other meant

Watch is ticking like a heartbeat gone berserk
Lost the chance to wind the key
Roosters are nothing but clucking clockwork
Our fears are only what we tell them to be
Our fears are only what we tell them to be

Drown the last of our matches
Burn the rest of each other
You were strongest when I ached for breath
Through the thick of smoke we'll finally smother

You'll come back to me for a little love that's true.

Flowers they will only die
And though you'll never take a shower together

It's a long, long journey
But I'll make it before I'm blue
This world can't throw me
Mama, if I still have you"

Soft winds blowing through the pinewood trees
Folks down there like a life of ease
When old mammy falls upon her knees
It's sleepy time down south

Steamboats on the river a coming or a going
Splashing the night away
Hear those banjos ringing, the people are singing
They dance til the break of day, hey

Dear old southland with his dreamy songs
Takes me back there where I belong
How I'd love to be in my mammy's arms

I've learned my lesson and I ain't ready to go yet
Let me tell you all about it

I dreamed last night I got on the boat to Heaven
And by some chance I had brought my dice along
And there I stood, and I hollered, ""Someone fade me""
But the passengers they knew right from wrong

For the people all said
""Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat""
And the people all said
""Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat""

""And the devil will drag you under
By the sharp lapel of your checkered coat
Sit down, sit down
Sit down you're rocking the boat""

Now I sailed away on that little boat to Heaven
And by some chance found a bottle in my fist
And there I stood nicely passin' out the whiskey
But the passengers were bound to resist

For the people all said
""Beware, you are on a heavenly trip""
People all said
""Beware, beware you'll scuttle the ship""

â€½And the devil will drag you under
By the fancy tie 'round your wicked throat
Sit down, sit down
Sit down you're rockin' the boat""

Now as I laughed at those passengers to Heaven
A great big wave came and washed me overboard
And as I sank, and I hollered, ""Someone save me""
That's the moment I woke up, thank the Lord

And I said to myself
 â€½Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat""
I said to myself
 â€½Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat""

â€½And the devil will drag you under
With a soul so heavy you'd never float
Sit down, sit down
Sit down you're rockin' the boat""
Sit down you're rockin' the boat

Sit down you're rockin' the boat
And I ain't gonna rock it no more"

As soft as the willow, the wisp
And in its song there is sadness
Because there's no you

The lonely autumn trees as softly as they're sayin'
For someone's dying
They know that in my heart there's not gladness
Because there's no you

The pub that we walk in, the garden we tug in
Are lonesome, they seemed in the fall
The stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the world

In spring we'll meet again, we'll kiss and recapture
The summer times raptured, we knew
And from that day nevermore will I say
There's no you"

Walkin' my baby back home
Arm in arm over meadow and farm
Walkin' my baby back home

We go 'long harmonizing a song
Or I'm reciting a poem
Owls go by they give me the eye
Walkin' my baby back home

Now we stop for a while, she gives me a smile
And snuggles her head on my chest, baby
We start in to pet and that's when I get
Her talcum powder all over my vest

And after I kinda straighten my tie
She borrows my comb
One kiss then I continue again
Walkin' my baby back home"

3280,Hip-Hop,Louis Armstrong,Miscellaneous ,Frankie And Johnny ,"Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
Oh, what a couple in love
Frankie was loyal to Johnny
Just as true as the stars above

He was her man
But he done her wrong

Frankie went down to the drugstore
Some ice cream she wanted to buy
The soda jerk told her that Johnny
Was making love to Nellie Bly

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

Now Frankie's dad was a policeman
She stole his old forty four gun
Then back to the drugstore she beat it
Just as fast as she could run

After her man
Who was doing her wrong

Now Frankie peaked in on the party
She got a surprise when she saw
That Nellie and Johnny were making love
And sipping soda through a straw

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

So Frankie flew into a tantrum
She whipped out that old forty four
And her rootie toot boom, that gal did shoot
Right through that hard wood swinging door

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

So bring on your crepe and your flowers
Bring on your rubber tired hack
'Cause there's eight men to go to the graveyard
But only seven are coming back

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

Now this is the end of my story
And this is the end of my song
Frankie is down in the jail house
And she cries the whole night long

""He was my man
But he was doing me wrong"""

Spoken the smoke was broke, no joke, not a jitney on him

Easy rider's gotta stay away
So he had to vamp it but the hike ain't far
He's gone where the southern cross' the Yellow Dog

I know the Yellow Dog district like a book
Indeed I know the route that rider took
Ev'ry cross tie, bayou, burg and bog
Way down where the southern cross' the Dog

Money don't zactly grow on trees
On cotton stalks it grows with ease
No race horse, race track, no grand stand
Is like old beck and buckshot land

Down where the southern cross' the Dog
Every kitchen there is a cabaret
Down there the Boll Weevil works while the darkies play
This Yellow Dog blues the live long day

Dear Sue, your easy rider struck this burg today
On a south-bound rattler side door Pullman car
Seen him here an' he was on the hog
Spoken the smoke was broke, no joke, not a jitney on him

Easy rider's gotta stay away
So he had to vamp it but the hike ain't far
He's gone where the southern cross' the Yellow Dog"

Memories of you

I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low

I'm beginning to see the light
Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light"

3301,Hip-Hop,Louis Armstrong,Miscellaneous ,I Love Jazz ,"A little jazz is just a bit of this
And that sometimes we sing
Sometimes we play, sometimes we scat
But most of all it's how you feel about the groove
And when it's groovin', how the groove makes you move

Jazz music sprouted rock and roll
It was the very first music that we call soul
Jazz is hot, it's cool, it's good, it's bad
And it can change your mood to happy from sad

Jazz is hip, it's groovy, it's fresh, it's jive
And when you play it, it makes your soul come alive
You know it's the up beat rhythm that makes it bop
And once you get it started, well, it sure is hard to stop

No other music can compare
When the bass starts walkin' it fills the air
You know that the sass of brass has made it last
And it's the groove of blues from present to past

Hey, what about some of those great legends of jazz?
Yeah, like Jazz Royalty
Oh, you mean Duke Ellington and Count Basie
What about the great horn players?
Louis Armstrong, yeah, and Miles and Dizzy too

Don't forget Snookie
What about Yarnburn?
What? Don't you mean Charlie Parker?
Yeah, this cool named Freddy Hubert

A little jazz is just a little bit of this
And that sometimes we sing
Sometimes we play, sometimes we scat
But most of all it's how you feel about the groove
And when it's grovin', how the groove makes you move"

You lift me to the skies my heart flip flops

You always kinda knew that we would gel
'Cause jam could never shake like that

But I knew you wouldn't quit when I dug you
And you hit me with that old time jive

I miss it each night and day
The longer I stay away

Miss the moist covered vines
The tall sugar pines
Where mocking birds use to sing
And I like to see the lazy Mississippi
Are hurrying to spring

The Mardi Gras memories
Of Creol Tunes that fill the air
I dream of Orleanders in June
And soon I'm wishing that I was there

Do you know what is means
To miss New Orleans
And there is something more
I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans"

There were three children from the land of Israel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
They took a little trip to the land of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

Nebudchanezzer was the King of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
They took a lot of gold and made an idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

And he told everybody
â€½When you hear the music of the tromboneâ€
And he told everybody
â€½When you hear the music of the clarinetâ€

And he told everybody
â€½When you hear the music of the horn
Oh, you must fall down and worship the idolâ€
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

But the children of Israel would not bow down
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
â€½Couldn't fool me with no golden idolâ€
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

â€½I said, you couldn't fool me with your golden idolâ€
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Oh, Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

So the king put the children in a fiery furnace
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Heaped on coals and red-hot brimstone
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

Eleven times hotter, hotter than it ought to be
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Burned up the soldiers that the king had put there
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

But the Lord sent an Angel with the snow white wings
Down in the middle of the furnace
And talking to the children 'bout the power of Gospel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

Well, they couldn't find a hair on the head
Of Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Laughing and talking about the fire jumping around
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

Oh, Nebudchanezzer [Incomprehensible]
When he saw the power of the Lord
And [Incomprehensible] in the house of Babylon

But I can still recall
A summer sky

To all romantic things
The memories that it brings
Will never die

I shall always remember
The night you went away
I shall always remember
The night I had to say

Goodbye to summer

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes, I wonder, why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago, now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale

A paradise where roses bloom
Though, I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain"

Raised in the woods so's he knew ev'ry tree, kilt him a b'ar when he was only three
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier!

In eighteen thirteen the Creeks uprose, addin' redskin arrows to the country's woes
Now, Injun fightin' is somethin' he knows, so he shoulders his rifle an' off he goes
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

Off through the woods he's a marchin' along, makin' up yarns an' a singin' a song
Itchin' fer fightin' an' rightin' a wrong, he's ringy as a b'ar an' twic't as strong
Davy, Davy Crockett, the buckskin buccaneer!

Andy Jackson is our gen'ral's name, his reg'lar soldiers we'll put to shame
Them redskin varmints us Volunteers'll tame, 'cause we got the guns with the sure-fire aim
Davy, Davy Crockett, the champion of us all!

Headed back to war from the ol' home place, but Red Stick was leadin' a merry chase
Fightin' an' burnin' at a devil's pace, south to the swamps on the Florida Trace
Davy, Davy Crockett, trackin' the redskins down!

Fought single-handed through the Injun War, till the Creeks was whipped an' peace was in store
An' while he was handlin' this risky chore, made hisself a legend for evermore
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier!

He give his word an' he give his hand, that his Injun friends could keep their land
An' the rest of his life he took the stand, that justice was due every redskin band
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his promise dear!

Home fer the winter with his family, happy as squirrels in the ol' gum tree
Bein' the father he wanted to be, close to his boys as the pod an' the pea
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his young'uns dear!

But the ice went out an' the warm winds came, an' the meltin' snow showed tracks of game
An' the flowers of Spring filled the woods with flame, an' all of a sudden life got too tame
Davy, Davy Crockett, headin' on West again!

Off through the woods we're ridin' along, makin' up yarns an' singin' a song
He's ringy as a b'ar an' twict as strong, an' knows he's right 'cause he ain' often wrong
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

Lookin' fer a place where the air smells clean, where the trees is tall an' the grass is green
Where the fish is fat in an untouched stream, an' the teemin' woods is a hunter's dream
Davy, Davy Crockett, lookin' fer Paradise!

Now he's lost his love an' his grief was gall, in his heart he wanted to leave it all
An' lose himself in the forests tall, but he answered instead his country's call
Davy, Davy Crockett, beginnin' his campaign!

Needin' his help they didn't vote blind, They put in Davy 'cause he was their kind
Sent up to Nashville the best they could find, a fightin' spirit an' a thinkin' mind
Davy, Davy Crockett, choice of the whole frontier!

The votes were counted an' he won hands down, so they sent him off to Washin'ton town
With his best dress suit still his buckskins brown, a livin' legend of growin' renown
Davy, Davy Crockett, the Canebrake Congressman!

He went off to Congress an' served a spell, fixin' up the Govern'ments an' laws as well
Took over Washin'ton so we heered tell, an' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear!

Him an' his jokes travelled all through the land, an' his speeches made him friends to beat the band
His politickin' was their favorite brand, an' everyone wanted to shake his hand
Davy, Davy Crockett, helpin' his legend grow!

He knew when he spoke he sounded the knell, of his hopes for White House an' fame as well
But he spoke out strong so hist'ry books tell, an' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear!

When he come home his politickin' done, the western march had just begun
So he packed his gear an' his trusty gun, an' lit out grinnin' to follow the sun
Davy, Davy Crockett, leadin' the pioneer!

He heard of Houston an' Austin so, to the Texas plains he jest had to go
Where freedom was fightin' another foe, an' they needed him at the Alamo
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

His land is biggest an' his land is best, from grassy plains to the mountain crest
He's ahead of us all meetin' the test, followin' his legend into the West
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier!"

Rambo
He's got that funny name
An' ramblin' that's his game, that's it
He's Rambo, talkin' bout 
Me!
We'll see (Piano)
They call him Rambo 'cause he's travellin'
He don't stay one place
His life's a string he keeps unravellin'
He don't leave no trace
He's got a yen for changin' places
He digs changin' scenes
That way he stays in everybody's good graces

He's happy on the move
He's mobile and free
He wants no strings attached
That's how it's gotta be, see!
He'll keep on ramblin' till the coda
He don't stay one place
Because he's just a ramblin' man
His favorite hobby's hittin' the road
He was a fella livin' solely by the ramblers only code
Some people're born to roam
Fate gave 'em roamin' natures

An' so they wander aroun'
Leavin' people wondrin' when they'll touch the groun'
Hither 'n yon, here 'n beyon'
Wherever they never been before
As soon as you're used t'their face

They're off 'n runnin' again
Gone to another new place
Peripatetic is the only word 
that I have ever heard that people could use
that really describes him
There's no other word could do that
Only other word I know that comes 
The closest to it is ""Gypsy""
An' that don't really fit him at all
""Cause he ain't tellin' fortunes
'N hates bein' dipsy
Everywhere I go they call him Rambo
'Cause he won't stay long

In my ramblin'
I've met a lotta people here 'n there
An' I find they're 'bout the same everywhere
Each with his own little thing
That he uses while he's tryin' to swing
Maybe the look ain't the same
But they play the same game
An' there's quite a bit o' difference
In their outlook, I know
Still 'n yet, their story, lem'me tell you
Is a story that you won't forget
When I was young 'n very green
I felt so stuck with m'present situation
Later, when I got a little older
that was when I discovered I could split
'N find myself another groove
That was all I need
I was on the move
I packed my little sack 'n started ramblin'
To this day I'm a rover who'll always be ramblin'

You git drug stayin' in one place
Depressed an' feelin' low down
Get new kicks movin' roun'

Roamin' the country's educational for you
'N widens your point of view
Tests y' mettle 'n cools y' mind out
'N that's true without a doubt
Y know? I mean y'dig - -
That's Rambo's gig
Rambo is ready to ramble 'n itchin' t'split
Oh yeah, he'll start packin' 'n quit it
Forget it! 'Cause he's done with it

That's Rambo! Travellin' light
Stay too long he'll git uptight
So his motto is ""Keep movin'""
You got it! That's his bit!
Nex' time he might leave an address
'Cause the little girl that he met
Las' night
Paid him so much attention
That it got him a bit uptight
We might not have t'call him Rambo
'Cause he jes' might be settlin' down

'Bout a spirit who would someday come

'N y' could see they prob'ly had some
So they welcomed 'em with peace and love
And everything there's plenty of

Incorporated into what a cat'll think is factual

Let me introduce you
I've heard that boredom's entered your life
And you're feelin' real low
Have you met Benny Bailey?
Well he's a fella that you should know

They tell me lassitude's has laid you low
An' you're losin' your grip
you must meet Benny Bailey
At least he's somebody who is hip

To cure an ennui, you need a bon nuit
It's part o' the joie de vie
And his attention, I'm loathe to mention
Is, incident'ly, available

And so if providence should decree
Who'll stand in the way
So you'll meet Benny Bailey
And you'll remember your lucky day

Background Vocals: Once you've met
You won't forget
No stuff

This could be your lucky day
Incident'ly, he's the sort
Tho' seen at court
Carries an awful lotta weight
In many less royal quarters
Filled with less than regal daughters
Quite the quixotic Romeo whom every 
Filly'll know because they find his
Reputation wherever they go
Whether it's here
Or whether it's in another boudoir
Whee!
He's such a scandal, really
T' handle him demands a savoir fairer
And a great indulgence rarer
Than any that I've encountered surveyin' the scene
But never mind, I'll explain it later
The fact is that he's always ready to please
And that's aroused a lot o'chatter
But it really doesn't matter, not to him
No siree! It's 'bout as big t'him as any flea
He's gotta be maitre'd
Or so it seems to me
Wait'll y'meet, you'll see what I'm sayin'

He's where it's at
That's right, outta sight

Echos throughout the universe
For endless spans of time uncountable

Clifford played
They are with us now
And I'm positive that they will endure
Should time and sacred circumstance allow
Yes, they'll live forever

Oh, yes, I remember Clifford now
Seems I always feel that Clifford's spirit's
Hangin' roun' me somehow

Could really be said to have gone away

Is deep inside you whether you're diggin' it or not
Once you're aware of this spring
You'll know that it's the greatest 
Treasure you've got
And furthermore
The joy spring, the bounteous treasure
Cannot be bartered away and never
Can be sold
Nothing can take it from you
It's yours and yours alone to have
And to hold
And something more:
It never is lost to fire or theft
It's always around
When trouble is gone the pleasure
Is left I've always found
It's burglar-proof same as the treasure
Man lays up in heaven worth a
Price no one can measure
that says a lot
So joy spring this fountain of pleasure

When he was searchin' for the fountain of youth

Ol' Ponce de Leon laughed so much he 
Never did find the magic fountain
But many people with a well-adjusted
Spirit they could hear it when y'told
'em it was there tellin' them was
Like tellin' it on the mountain

It's quite a life havin' the gift of 
laughter I'm a man who knows in a
minute I can tell y'just exactly how the story goes
It involves a firm conviction in another 
previous life givin' your mind a chance to fly
Fly aroun' the universe investigatin' other
galaxies n' certain other subtle
types o'life tryin' t'dig it gettin'
pretty well-acquainted with a lot of
other strife an' pretty much acquirin'
yourself plenty of education
pretty soon here comes earth birth
'n then y'ready t'put it all t'work
but soon as you're finished bein' born
you start forgettin' what you knew
'Cause you're another kinda you - a
reincarnation manifestation
of spirit in sensation

Y'really got that right
The average person isn't bright
not so bright that they recall the fatal fall
down here t' this earth
their minds disguise their death to spirit
life and call it birth
that's their reason for forgetting and they 
find it very upsetting when reminded 
tell 'em they've lived before
They'll show y' the nearest open door
Gotta have feelin' while dealin' with
walkers in their sleep
they can't imagine somethin' as deep

Here they come - here they come - there they are
Unimaginative and ignorant of falling from a star
Here they come - there they are - there they go
Life is over in a minute an' they never dug
it in it or enjoy a minute of it
'cause they put too much above it
that was gross
somethin' that was worth a couple bucks
at mos'

So there is the reason that the maker of man
included there in his plan
A certain fountain deep within'
where there was laughter, youth 'n gold
for human beings t'have 'n hold
'n share the memory of where we've all been

Brothers called Grimm knew chances were slim'
Anybody would dig that the human soul 
was Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs were seven tempers 
in man 
whose digging out the gold completes 
the plan
An Bacon was hip that Shakespeare 
couldn't read
and so he gave him all the rhymes
that have lasted through the years
and kept eternal truths alive through
several centuries
That's how we know them now 
they lasted 'cause they're true

What was it from ""MacBeth?""
""Life's but a walking shadow
a player poor
that struts and frets upon the stage
and's seen no more
A tale that truly has an idiotic ring
That's full of lotsa sound and fury
signifying nothing...""

That's right signifying nothing
I'll repeat it! Nothing
Don't forget it - Nothing
And that's the reason for that spring 
of joy
That the Father put inside of every
single girl and boy

Show time! Everyone's on
let's hit the stage
It's show time everyone an' proceed 
to act your age

Whatever you're frownin' at is funny
enough f'laughin'
so you're wastin' all your humor on a frown
While you're bringin' your spirit down

You gotta book yourself a comic in your act
without some laughter life's a maudlin
farce 'n that's a fact

Once you know about the spring you always can smile
It becomes your one expression
and you're always wearin' it like the 
Buddhas do

(Repeat Intro to *)
(Coda)
Ponce de Leon sought this
When he was searchin' 
for the fountain of youth
I say in truth he
sought a magical thing
For he was searchin'
for the joy spring"

Move
Move, c'mon -- move

Nothing's lacking motion
Not the heavens or the ocean
Or the planets or the weather
All are moving all together
On the move

Let's go - let's go
Let's get t'movin' it
Let's go - Let's get t'groovin' it
Why're y'hesitating
Can't you feel the rhythm waitin'
Strike a groove, let's move
Git it on!

That's right! That's right!
Don't ever have t'fight
That's right
Don't hold y'self so tight
Give it a solid minute
And you'll find you've fallen in it
What's to prove?

Just move - git it on

Move it any way you want to move
As long as you can fin' a groove
that's cool, that'll do

Move fast or move it slow
Same any way you go

I'm movin' I'm movin'
I'm taking it on out
Gotta bottle up 'n git it
Listen to me - dig
Time never hesitates,
It's always just a little bossy

Everybody knows a rolling stone 
Is never really very mossy
Y' never wanna hesitate
Y' feet'll take y'with 'em
'Cause when y'moving
You ain't got the time
F'nothing else
But paying strict attention
To the music and the fascinatin' rhythm
So I'm tellin' y'man
To move it right along

'N hurry up and sing your little song
'N while you're moving madly
You can sing yourself a happy
Little ditty while you groove
And then you never have to worry
'Bout striking a good groove

I was diggin' whatcha talkin' 'bout
And listenin' to the groovy way
You spit it out
And baby that was really somethin' to hear
Funny, when you're movin' and you're groovin'
How you haven't got a second
F' a little light revivin'
'Cause you go too fast
Time passes, this groove's too good to last
When you're talking fas' y'lyin'
'N there ain't nobody buyin'
That's the sayin'
Everybody's layin' down
But you got a way
Playing what you play
Saying what you say
Turnin' everything 'round
Everybody's gotta dig it
If they don't they're deaf

I can testify that you were really gittin' in it
Much as any person ever could
'N y'really did it good

Come and face the facts
Come show the people how you move it on the sax
Rich, you move in style!
Make all the moves, find all the strangest grooves
Man , what a tone!
Come play the saxophone
Come show the people how you move it on the horn

Let's git movin' it
Git to groovin' it
Better get to movin' while the gittin' is good
Let's go - let's go
Let's move git it on

Let's go - let's go
Why are you hesitatin'?
Can't y'feel the rhythm waitin'?
Strike a groove
Let's move git it on

When y'hold yourself tight?
Let's go - let's go

Metropolis
Once there was light
Perfectly white
Far as the eye could wander
Once there was time
Morning and night
Once there was sky -- over yonder

The day begins
Metropolis lies sleeping like a drunken soldier
Behind the wheel you come alive
And down into its heart you motor
Atop the rise - Metropolis
Defender of the high and mighty
At every turn the homeless wait
Reminding you of all that might be

Hurry now, there is somebody there to meet you
Office girls sweet and innocent poised to greet you
Through the glass fifty stories below you
There's a place I've been meaning to show you
Full of sights that are certain to blow you away

Beneath the haze
Metropolis awakens with a hiss and rumble
You'll hear a knock, don't hesitate
They mustn't ever see you stumble
You'll never last down on the street
Where staying on your toes ain't ballet
It's getting by or getting beat
From curtain to the grand finale

In the air there is music and sounds of laughter
For the moment it's happily ever after
Through the glass fifty stories below you
In the shadows where nobody knows you
There's a stranger who's dying to show you the way

Now entering Metropolis
Creation of a world gone crazy
The alleyway - the resting place
Still echo from the souls trapped under
You lock the doors, step on the gas
And push until it goes no faster
You close your eyes and leave behind 
Metropolis lord and master"

To the conscience of the people
To the children on the beach
Son of Africa and legend
Music made of pain and pleasure
Brought the nation to its feet
Every whisper sounds like thunder

Far away from home but meanwhile
Popularity increased 
Radio reversed his fortune
He was welcomed with emotion
A voice no one could defeat
Now they crank up the Victrola
In the corner bars and oh, my, 
How the ladies start to weep
Every word describes their hunger

Goodbye Love
Goodbye love...
The shadows climb the wall
The door is closing, now on to
something more

And goodbye love
A whisper down the hall
The wind that's all
You still don't call

Maybe I'll drink too much 
Try not to think too much
And lie awake each night until
the dawn

Goodbye love
We hardly ever flew
But I'll remember
At least forever
The time of love and you"

The light of angels shone above him
They mentioned God would surely love him...
To play ""My dear, Ruby""

So Monk

Sat down and played a chorus
And God said, ""Monk...the door is open to my house"

She looked just like a royal queen
And she cruises by with some wealthy guy
In a Cadillac limousine, last time
Last time I saw Jeannine

Last time, last time I saw Jeannine
Recall when we were seventeen
I was a beau 'twas not so long ago
But too short of that long lost dream
To satisfy Jeannine

Now she's gone from me
Moved away from the old neighborhood
And I'm certain she's gone for good

Last time, last time I saw Jeannine
The dollar signs stood in between
It was a love lost to the rising cost
But since then, I have never seen
I haven't seen Jeannine

Now she's gone from me
Moved away from the old neighborhood
And I'm certain she's gone for good

The Jungle Pioneer
Here where we stand there used to be a forest
A timber rising endlessly before us
We cleared away that God forsaken jungle
And in return the Indians adore us

What was mud now is a highway
Reaching wide into a prairie
Horses run -- cattle are grazing
You would swear it was Oklahoma

Day by day dark is illuminated
God's mistake altered and uncreated
Wrong's made right left to the jungle pioneer

See in the field my little son and daughter
Not long ago that ground was underwater
Now you can see them walking with the cattle
Singing them songs before they go to slaughter

There are those who would appose us
Crying out, ""God save the planet""
Bleeding hearts can't turn assunder
This the eighth and final wonder

Day by day this land is liberated
God's mistake altered and uncreated
Wrong's made right left to the jungle pioneer

Saddle up giddy up and ride on out of here
We got a mile of burning to do today
Get along now gonna need you out of here
We got a pile of earning to do today

Down in Brazil there used to be a forest
Now in it's place a crazy wind is whistling
As every tree was falling in the forest
It made a sound but nobody was listening

When the last is buried under
What has been will be no longer
No matter what man may endeavor
Eden's gate closes forever

Day by day life is eliminated
God's own work altered and eliminated
Through it all there stands the jungle pioneer"

Notes From The Underground
Beneath the marbled halls of Pretoria
There's the faintest sound rising from the underground
Behind the prison walls poets fantasize
Voices lost are found captive in the underground
The dream is still alive, immune to their commands
Bravery abounds steadfast in the underground
Until the day arrives, children understand
Father's safe and sound living in the underground

Look to the days ahead
Gather your prayers like roses
Think of the life that waits after the battle's over
Look to the land beyond you 
Out where the fields are golden
There will be gifts untold, yes after the battle's over
If I should not return, know that you are my pleasure
Shelter yourselves, my treasures, until the battle's over

The dream is still alive, immune to their commands
We are pound for pound stronger in the underground
The longer we survive the less they can withstand
Time will turn around over to the underground

10 miles from Soweto under a thorn tree's branches
Shanty will be no longer after the battle's over
Somewhere a breeze is drifting over a blue-green ocean
There will be time for beauty after the battle's over
Children, I must be going - cherish your mother's memory
Now turn these words to ashes antes que seja tarde

The dream is still alive, immune to their commands
Time will turn around over to the underground
The longer we survive the less they can withstand
Time will turn around over to the underground

Beneath the marbled halls where the power lies
There's the faintest sound rising from the underground
Behind the prison walls poets fantasize
Voices lost are found captive in the underground

The dream is still alive, immune to their commands
Bravery abounds steadfast in the underground
Until the day arrives, children understand
Father's safe and sound living in the underground"

'Bout the time when Jelly Roll was in town

He heard a local pianist
What joy!
Stompin' out music on an old upright pi-ano
Here comes King
that was downright ragged in a Scott Joplin way
(Here he comes-Master of the stomp)
Ol' Jelly knew the fella could play
Dig him!
by the things he heard his right hand say
(Now - we're gonna romp)

(There was no doubtin' that the man could swing)

When Jelly Roll demanded his name
Hail! King Porter
Well, the man responded ""Porter King""
(Dig 'Im!) By order!
Well, Jelly lef' th' city, but he wrote
(Dig 'Im!) Y' wanna dig 'im
a rompin' ditty 'bout the Porter
(Dig 'Im!) Y' gonna dig 'im
who was ""King O' The Stomp""
Porter King sho' can stomp

Jelly wrote a ditty 'bout a fella who could romp
This is the tune - ""King Porter Stomp""

When Porter's stridin' hands are flyin'
An' all his fingers are testifyin'
His two feet stompin' in ragged time
That's a feelin' that is so sublime - Y' dig it?

He's generatin' so much excitement
Y' keep forgettin' just what uptight meant
N' that's that fella named Porter King
His style's the essence o' Swing

(Well, well, well)

Oh, well, go on n' tell it

Cheryl's solo:
When Jelly first heard Porter King
He declared he heard the very heart an' soul of swing
A certain ragged kind o' romp 
in between a jump and a stomp
When Jelly heard, well, he really knew
because he played too
That Porter was a King, really n' truly a stone king
Another thing, somethin' never heard of
""Somethin' else"" is the sort o' phrase
A fella'd prob'ly have t'use
if'e was gonna describe
the way Porter plays

There never was - an never's gonna be
another strider fine as he
I know no other ear will ever hear another like it here.

Verse:
I'm gonna paint a sepia panorama
so full of life the painting will come alive
Bathed in blues 'n full of drama
An' all the swing they needed so they'd survive
I'll add some tans an' yellow ocher
Such soul! So full of rhythm
an' then some orange t' tone up the black a bit
My goal is to be with 'em
Purple haze t' lull the smoker
What swing! What syncopation
an cherry red t' loosen the back a bit
That thing captured a nation

An' then a mere patina of subtle green
Get down with me - you'll dig my study in brown
to lighten up the purple n' tone it down
Get down with me - tell about it all over town
A dancing glow to highlight the subtle scene
Get down with me - Dig how I'm paintin' the town
an' there you'll have a study in brown
My study in brown

Well, git brown!
Oh yeah, brown is the pigment
Well, git down!
Oh yeah, that's what cha' really meant

Once a mockingbird (dig) - he was overheard (what)

""All you bovine creatures - dig what I'm layin' down!""

All you sinners drop everything

Lift arms up to Heaven and sing

Sing you sinners woncha sway n' swing

Don't be silent - Let the Lord hear y'shout

And jus' let the music come out

Sing you sinners woncha sway n' swing

In a world where there's no music
(Old Scratch)
Satan gets his kicks
(He's up to his tricks)
He'll be laughing up and down the banks
(Hee, hee, hee)
Of that river Styx

You're so wicked baby, and you're depraved
You can rave
It's apparent that you have misbehaved
To your grave
But if you should wanna be saved
Jus' behave
Take a listen now to the bird...

Stop all that chewin' yer cud - and all that standin' in the mud there
Swing people! Swing every chortle from yer mortal portal
I dig that everyone believes that all cattle prodigies
are like a sneeze
Hard blowin'-missin one lick of blowin' talent to show

(If y'sing - y' gotta swing!)

But remember that the day will come when you 
will be just steak on a plate
(Folks, y'know it's fate)
So dig the music of the swing-o-sphere -
(before your swing arrives too late)

Janis' solo, continued:
That's a little too dark
Still, it's true - we've got breath for such a limited time
What are ya, stupid, ya cows?? - you'd think to sing was a crime

In defense now; hence now; Here's comes Adele McCluck:

Cheryl's solo:
Mrs. Mockingbird, I must say you haven't heard
the friendly bellowing swing of our friends the cows - 
as they shed their way from Teagarden to Fuller
Instead of spendin' ev'ry day jus' sneakin' around
to life another lick -
These cats work on their cow-tone, so when they get up to blow
They blow a fatter bone-tone into the ozone

(And furthermore...)

Alan's solo:
You tweety-birds are always singin' away
Never givin' up thought of what you say
We cows do - shedding takes up most of our day
So when we start and settle in to play - we can say
A moo is an array of what we've always known to be
the best and only way to play

(What we mean to say is...)

Before the band will letcha sing
(Sing with Fletcher Henderson)
You've got to get y'self to swing
(Like the Bean or Satch)
So your horn can blow - a single note or two
of deeper thinking
(That's the way to swing)
So set your mind upon a tone
(When you're shedding all alone)
And you will have a cornerstone
(Like the bass trombone)
Blow your horn and take a bow
So that you're swinging like the cows
Pythagoras would be so proud of us"

Clouds (Adapted From ""Nuages"")
See the white and fluffy clouds
Adore the sun
As he shines his light
On each and every one
Still, those clouds can hide his light
Till the day becomes like night
So my light heart would darken too
If I ever lost you

As the clouds begin to shed
Their tears of rain
So my aching heart would
Shed its tears of pain
Till that happy moment when
Darkened clouds roll by and then
White and fluffy clouds 
Adore the sun once again

Cheryl's Solo:
When I was young
I'd long to touch a cloud
On my back on a bed of green
I'd contemplate the cloud scene
They would form themselves 
into a lot o' different kinds o' pictures 
Of the kind that pre-existed in my mind
Paintin' the kind o' scene
That I never saw on a wide screen
Look! Ain't that Moses on the mount!
There! Monte Christo an' a gallant count!
Four white horses and a coach
Proceeding madly to approach
the sunlit castle of his majesty the king

Isn't that a flying saucer
and a pilgrim out of Chaucer going by?
They're all right there in a cloud 
Standing tall and proud
How thrilling to see!
A panorama that will never end
like the movies do
""Cause they're yours alone
an' under your direction
How'd y'like the movie
that was showin' t'day?
An' what a cast!
An' not only the casting
but a story full of glory everlasting
the errant, fluffy clouds
doing everything they have always done
Like adore the sun
Come out an' do their thing again

Stephane Grappelli/Stochelo Rosenberg Solo
See the white, fluffy clouds adore the sun
As he shines his light on each and every one
White and fluffy clouds adore the sun
Once again."

To say what we mean,

That's when the pain will occur

She will fall so far and

So treasure her heavenly pleasure

Just reassure her that
You love her
That you love her

It's such a mystery sharing
your passionate pleasures
You wrestle with your soul,
your dreams won't last forever

Drink lotsa coffee babe
You'll begin just where you left off
And you can tell how high
you flew and how you fell
And I'll make your landing soft

My place is cute
And it's kind of comfortable
in a storm, safe and warm
We'll throw open the nighttime
and let in the sunshine
If you'll just confide in me,
just confide in me

Yes I'm strong on careless hearts
I'm strong on brave new starts
Confide in me, I'll hold your hand
Confide in me, I'll understand
You say you've slipped,
made a mistake
Confide in me, for goodness sakes"

The Quietude (Encuentro De Animales)
In ancient times great fear arose
among the inhabitants of
Tiahuanacu, the Spaniards were
coming into their lands. The Indians
retreated to their houses in great fear
and closed themselves in total
isolation without food or water.
They sat down in great sorrow with
knees bent and heads bowed (they
are called Chullpas) and died.
They were buried in this position.
Others froze to death in a standing
position like stone monoliths
(monolitos). The Indians who live
there today are very poor - no
clothes or food. They seek a better
life and move to the cities where they
learn to read, write and do any kind
of work. They earn money and don't
want to return to their homelands.

Night calls through the air
reaching for its solitude
Dusk lures like a lyre beckoning
the quietude

In state of constant commotion
full of rage and heartless devotion
There's a need that burns within to
fly away, just fly away

Soft winds kiss the land
silent and in gratitude
Children hand in hand
comprehend the quietude
Through a maze of fear
and compulsion
There's a race for the power
and fortune
Still a need within cries out to
fly away, just fly away

People rush, people flee, they
move so fast that they cannot see
Work all day, up all night, they
push and hide all the joy inside
Like a wave that breathes in 
the ocean and the mountains
peak with emotion
There's a need that calls within
to find a way, just find a way

Time to leave and fly away,
to take a leave and castaway
To leave the worries and the dismay,
it's time to go,
it's time to play it's...

Time now to fly away,
take leave and castaway
To fly...
The moon it guides my way,
winds blow to show the way
To fly...

Dawn breaks, day descends
With a calming attitude
Shadows fall and bend
Welcome in The Quietude"

Puttin' forth a heathen horde
on his people
To blacken human spirit'll

When you comin' home?
When you comin' home?
Well, my heart is near home
ever home
None play our music
None paint our pictures
None make our spirit glow
My body's leaving but not me
Your face we will see
On the day that we're free
So go -- Pablo
When danger threatens I must flee

The darkness comes
with a roll of the drums

Dark! Dark!

All the people work
Yet there is no pay
No pay -- low pay
All the people work
Yet the children hunger on, Pablo

Hear me say Madre, mi Madre
The everlasting light of art
Will ever shine
As long as I'm away from home
The devil strikes without warning
Turn life's wheel aroun'
Black is white, wrong is right,
up is down

Life is heavy 'neath these

Los Conquistadores acted nice

And don't forget to brush 
Every little one
'Cause soon as your sleepin'
Teeth police will come checkin' to see if every pearl is glistenin'
Don't be missin' any spot or they'll tattle-tale ans Santa he won't come

You're dealin' with toyland springs
When he brings the season joy with toys and things
But if you go dancin' Samba through the night
Be warned, beware
Or else you'll scare the hair off of Rudolph and he'll fly from here
That's a fact and then you'll cry and rave and wish that you'd behaved
So heed this warning before morning comes upon you 
Go to sleep and goodnight!

Wish that the snowman soon would play
And they are sure to get their wishes met

Turnin' back the hands of time
Holdin' on to misty memories
Chasin' shadows thru the night
Tryin' to find that happy ending
Reaching out for another chance at heaven
We can still find the way if we try

You gotta believe in the mystery
How it used to be
We were more than lonely drifters in the dark
Oh I can remember the sun inside
When love held us tight
Can't you see I need that magic in my heart 
Instead of it tearing apart

Diamonds shinin' in the night
Lyin' soft and warm together
Only images survive
Can't this dream go on forever?
There is still time to lock away the sadness
Let the secrets of love start to smile

It's only believin' the mystery
Like it used to be
Baby bring back all the passion to my life
Oh don't you remember the tender days
All the love we made
Can't we feel that warm sensation here tonight, oh....

Lonely spirits seem to whisper in the wind
It's a silent song that's never meant to be
Since the dawn of time the mystery never ends
We can find forever
If we let love rise again

Won't you reach for another 
chance at heaven
We can still find the way if we try

It's only believin' in the mystery
How it used to be
Baby bring back all the passion to my life
Oh cause I can remember the tender days
All the love we made
I need to feel that warm sensation - oh baby

10 MINUTES TILL THE SAVAGES COME (lyrics by Brock Walsh)

Spiked heels and porkpie hat--
Have you on the mend in no time flat
A shimmy and a shake, a pitter and pat
Hey there sugar--
Take a look at that!

Don't you despair 'cause your fantasy life is nowhere
Under my care you'll be back in the pink
Drunk without a drink

Tunnel down in soft silk and satin
Loosen up and roll to the rumble of the drum
Make believe it's midnite in Manhattan
10 minutes till the savages come

Come here and don't look back--
Meet me at the end of the cul-de-sac
Come on!  Stand up at attention and I'll do the same
Hey there tiger, now don't you be ashamed

Life has a way of destroying our sense of child's play
But under my wing you'll be back in the pink 
Drunk without a drink

Tunnel down in soft silk and satin
Let your backbone roll to the rumble of the drum
Make believe it's midnite in Manhattan
10 minutes till the savages come

Sigmund Freud himself wouldn't need to worry
If his hands were tied by me
There's no neurosis that this doctor can't diagnose
I'll find the monster and deliver a lethal dose

Life has a way of destroying our sense of child's play
But under my wing you'll be back in the pink
Drunk without a drink

Helpless
Every day I walk some lonely street
Searchin' 'til you come back to me
People around just stop and stare
as if they know the hurt I bear
And suddenly I realize

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
Since you've been gone I've been cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

Without a word without a warning
you left my life on early morning
Did I lean on you a little too strong
Too much of you I depended on
All at once I'm alone

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
Since you've been gone I've been cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

In the shelter of your love my strength I found
But now I'm useless, darlin', since you're not around 
I'm helpless baby

GENTLEMAN WITH A FAMILY (lyrics by Cheryl Bentyne and Marc Jordan)

Scarecrow, weathered and weary
Fragile and old beyond his years
Here we are-- chosen
In your eyes, the truth lies frozen

Soldier in the city heat
Refugee on every street
And life goes by
Standing in the pouring rain

He's a gentleman with a family
A gentle man, living day to day
He's a gentleman with pride, one may conclude
Sign reads, ""Gentleman with a family will work for food""

Shadows haunting his tired eyes
Reaching beyond the empty hand
Here we are, the chosen
In your eyes, the truth lies, frozen

Soldier in the city heat
Refugee on any street
And life goes by
An apostle to those worn out souls

Big blues in the city, trailin' the main stroll (a kitty)
Cup o'joe, get witty.  At Deuce's Cafe, it's the mostest hideway

Mez muggles ""Flip Zooty Flim Plant you now solid, dig you later Slim""
First you crawl then you walk, scat then you talk
Hear the cool, feel the heat of the
Rhythm of the offbeat of avenues

Help me, he blew his wig
(Lay it on)
He plays gutbucket doghouse on the stand
(Really gone)
Hear that Gabriel's growl
Break it up, Beat it out.

The canary has got a frame
(She can chirp)
And some high-jiver knows her name 
(Dig his vine)
Cats all frisken' their whiskers...Ow
(Jam is on pops)
I collar all jive, give me five
(Now you dig, alive)
So I know you're alive
In the dim you've arrived

Cruel lips, whisper baby
Pulse of the neon, she's crazy
Smokin' eyes, get hazy
Like beauty to beast,
""You're the most to say the least""

Let's cut some rug gate these skins are a mess

Made her somethin' special doin' business on Broadway

One more time around Rosie
The bus for Cincinnati gettin' ready to leave

Out from Redfield South Dakota
All her friends went to LA
Guess her mama never told her she shoulda flown the other way
'Cause Aunt Betty drive a Cobra up and down the Sunset Strip
In the same old nasty business, but there's cowboys in her ______________.

Yeah gimme

Won't you give me just

One more time around Rosie
Slap me right between the eyes
Won't you give me just one more time around Rosie
Lift me up and slap me with your thighs

I hear Leroy livin' good now
Reads the daily news, drives an eight track El Dorado
Sportin' high Italian shoes
He owes it all to Rosie
Who's the shoes that coin them uptown hotel movies 
That made that little Brownie a star

Yeah one more time around Rosie
I'm the one who likes it upside down
Won't you give me
Just one more time around Rosie

When I hear this melody
This strange illusion takes over me
Through a tunnel of the mind
Perhaps a present or future time oh, oh

This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round
Pyramidal locomotion
From a mystic unknown zone

Hearin' the twilight

Saw the future through her third eye
People came with skepticism
Picking, testing her precision, no, wo, oh, oh
Suddenly they heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round
A signpost up ahead is calling 
Through the mystic unknown zone

One Mister Miller had a rare flight
Glen was up there boppin' a rhythm
Then the engine stopped to listen with him
Play that beat, oh, oh

Shaker Song
The fool screams, 'no more!'
He grabs his shirt and hits the door
What she needs from him he ignores.
It's a bore. Oh it's a bore. Oh it's a bore. Oh it's a bore.
(Oh it's a ...)

Blast the radio.
The hits just come and go.
Block out what he knows that he has blown 
(That he has blown...)

The night hangs its head
As the fool crawls into bed.
Still his hungry heart begs to be fed
All the words she once said
(That she said. That she said. That she said.)

So then he grabs his Chevrolet
In one more attempt to get away
But the thoughts of all the crimes of passion lay in his way.

He can shake the blues,
But you know he still can get confused.
It seems like such a waste
'Cause he can't shake her.
He can shake his tail, 
But you know his moves are getting stale
He's on the make, but oh, his heart can't fake
That he can't shake her.
He can't shake her. 
No, he can't shake her.

Romance falls like rain
But all the motives are insane
Everytime that he plays the game he feels the pain
(He feels the pain. Who is to blame? Who is to blame?)

He finds a joint that's jive
Guys are spinning girls like 45's.
All of the live bait sink for his lines they are so high

He knows he is beat
As his heart puts on the heat
Run from the street that don't even fit his feet
(Don't fit his feet. Now he can see. Now he can really see)

Tell him here's a telephone
He can beg to let the fool come home
He tells her that his life's a drag alone
(Can't be alone)

He can shake the blues,
But you know he still can get confused.
It seems like such a waste
'Cause he can't shake her.
He can shake his tail, 
But you know his moves are getting stale

Foreign Affair
When traveling abroad in the continental style
It's my belief that one must attempt to be discreet
And subsequently bear in mind your transient position
Allows you a perspective that's unique
Though you'll find your itinerary's a blessing and a curse
Your wanderlust won't let you settle down
And you wonder how you ever fathomed that you'd be content
To stay within the city limits of a small midwestern town
Most vagabonds I knowed don't ever want to find the culprit
That remains the object of their long relentless quest
The obsession's in the chasing and not the apprehending
The pursuit you see and never the arrest

Without fear or contradiction Bon Voyage is often hollered
In conjunction with a handkerchief from shore
By a girl that drives a Rambler and furthermore
Is overly concerned that she won't see him anymore
Planes and trains and boats and buses
Characteristically evoke a common attitude of blue
Unless you have a suitcase and a ticket and a passport
And the cargo that they're carrying is you
A foreign affair juxtaposed with a stateside
And domestically approved romantic fancy
Is mysteriously attractive due to circumstances knowing
I will only be parlayed into a memory"

You can never get away

Be aware of strangers in the dark

Passions justifying their positions

Maybe they can find a way
Past their pride
Live and let it die away

I used to be so fancy free,
But really lonesome as could be,
Till one lucky day, you came my way
I never knew what love was all about
UNTIL I MET YOU.

I knew it right from the start

I used to think there'd never be,
A girl who'd ever care for me,
Then, what d’ya know, you made it so, 
I never knew what love was all about,
UNTIL I MET YOU.

Once we start, then we'll never part

In my blue life, 
No one at all would even care if I cried.
(Hurtin' inside)
In my new life,
I'm walkin' tall, I got a feelin' of pride
Glowin' inside.

And, lover, you're the reason why, 
A lonely girl is ridin' high
Now, who do you see, lucky as me?
I never knew what love was all about,
UNTIL I MET YOU.

It's cherry pink -
And apple blossom white
That's right - pink and white
I be tellin' y' right
Who'da' ever believed a guy that 
Hustled pool was such a romantic;
He really was frantic

He pursue_________d me 
Chalkin’ his cue
Lemme’ tell y’ now, without a doubt
Gettin' ready for a little romance 
The rustic romeo pursued me 
Now is his chance
He showed me such emotion that I finally 
That's what t'do if he's got some eyes - - - - -
Took a notion to give in 
F'Hittin on you

An' when y' took the notion
Love is a game
Did you imagine his emotion
Everybody plays it the same
Ever was the kind t' go f'coolin'
It's a game - y' play by the rules

Did 'ja think he might be jivin' and only foolin'
Tho y' know the winners are victims
Or did you appraise it as real?
An' losers are fools

Did you go f'what came?
Now that you're his
Or was love in the game?
He c'n put his mind t'tending t' biz 
If love is the answer 
'Cause thats how it is -
Then you'll never, ever be quite the same 
When y' find love, that's the one thing
I'm sure you know that that's so 
You'll be sure of -

Well I dropped m'heart now an' bent it
Said a few sincere words
Never dreamin' that I meant it
To tell you the truth, I never,
ever really meant to begin it

How can you explain true love?
How can I disdain true love?
Love is real exciting it's so exciting - That when it
Turned me around I didn't feel like fighting

It wouldn't a caught me
Except when I saw you I was surer than sure
This really couldn't be
But what'y-know
It really was so!
I'm ready f'settlin' right down
No more runnin' around

And that's the truth, really the truth,
Really ain't puttin' on no act.
Really a fact
Really, this ain't no time f'jivin'
'Cause what I'm tellin' y' really comes 
Right from this heart of mine
An' lemme tell y' there's an awful lot o'
Sacrifice t' lay it on the line

What's this thing people call love
Something nobody has too much of
This game all misunderstand, but play it

One thing's sure; Love's what I'm in
Unloose cupid's bow, let it begin
That's it! Let that madness start!
There goes my heart!

It's got me stumblin', it's got me mumblin'
I'm like a ship without a rudder,
A car without wheels
Unless y' feel it, I can't reveal it
Y' gotta have it happen to y'
T' know how it feels

One thing's sure; Love has got me
I'm as certain as certain can be
I'm yours till eternity

From the day that we met
When you showed on the set
I remember it yet
I was knocked out

The Word Of, Confirmation
I'm here to just confirm what I've been
really always sayin'
About modern jazz
It's the savior of the nation
And I'll believe it if you do too
The rhythm & blues

Like Bird
When he thought of this melody
The message he played on his horn
Was the steady confirmation
That he discovered
The sound that makes the music be free

This may sound unstable
But I know I'm able to concentrate in song to you
My lyrics may go fast
Sometimes a word may get past folks
But so I keep it swingin'
I know I've got to stay true

So like the Bird I'm gonna say that jazz is always
A happiness groove
So come on and I'll confirm it
'Cause certainly the Bird that I heard
made the word of confirmation"

Spice Of Life
Down on the corner there's a reason to smile
When those evenin' shadows fall
Some kinda feelin' that it's hard to deny
Once the neon lights start to call
People out there searchin' for action
Daytime distraction slippin' right on by

Tonight, let's taste the spice of life
Keep it sweet until the mornin' light
Watch fantasy unfold
And let the lovin' flow

Caught in the madness of a summer romance
At a moonlight rendezvous
Lost in the spirit of a sensual dance
That can cast a spell over you
All you need's a night to remember
Flyin' together on the highest high

Tonight, let's taste the spice of life
A little music and some candlelight
Put passion in control
And let the lovin' flow

Could be the start of a million dreams we share
So lay back in the feelin' let the evenin' take you there

All we need is a night to remember 
Flyin' together on the highest high

Tonight, let's taste the spice of life
A little music and some candlelight
Put passion in control
And let the lovin' flow
All night we'll taste the spice of life
Keep it sweet until the mornin' light
Watch fantasy unfold
That's the only way to go"

Of breathing heads

A camera crew is running
The world is shrinking fast
Tonight you drink your coffee
And watch the world aghast

This independence
We are the metal shell
10,000 bodies
Run from an empty well
All of your lovers
Are heroes in my bed
All night the echoes
Of breathing heads

3470,Pop,Ed Sheeran,÷ (Divide) ,Eraser ,"I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the lord's house
But stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now, the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy, when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me, is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride

You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead I look in the mirror, questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day, for someone like me
Without a nine to five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors I'll find another use for the key, and you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more
I am another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the route of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fix, they break as well
And ain't nobody want to see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream and this should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm reverend run
I beg you don't be disappointed with the man I've become

Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12, telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people dad and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley stadium crowds, two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now, somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more
I am, another one to take the sting away
Oh I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Well save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
Where I'm heading who knows
My heart will stay the same

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away

I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
Those old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own

She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds

Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?

After dancing to Kaleigh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine

And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again and
You're like something that God has sent me

I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar upon my knuckle
And each graze upon my knee, and all I know is
I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, always say what's on your mind
And I am only, being honest with you, I I get lonely
And make mistakes from time to time

I remember less and less, and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans, are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams
And I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town
And spend the afternoon looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, always say what's on your mind
And I am only, being honest with you, I I get lonely

When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty two grand kids now growing old
In the house that your brother brought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met at her Guys in the second world war
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire, in our old armchairs
You know Nancy I adore ya

From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

She and I went on the run

I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles but would you do the same for me
Oh, honestly?

Offered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on and on

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon cause from here it looks the same?
And only scars remain

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if I don't then I'll go back to where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving, just like that
Oh I'm here again, between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong, cause I'm not like my mum
Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song, but it helps
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
Or drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself

3497,Pop,Gorillaz,Demon Days ,Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head ,"Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain,
there was a town where the people

known as Happyfolk lived,
their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
obscured as it was by great clouds. Here they played out their peaceful lives,
innocent of the litany of excess and violence that was growing in the world below.
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough.
Then one day

Strangefolk arrived in the town.

They came in camouflage,
hidden behind dark glasses

no one noticed them: they only saw shadows.
You see, without the Truth of the Eyes
the Happyfolk were blind.
(Singing)
Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody's dancing the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead
The dance of the dead.
(Talking)
In time,
the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
and it was there that they found the caves
of unimaginable Sincerity and Beauty. By chance,
they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest.
The Strangefolk
they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things,
and soon they began to mine
the mountain,
its rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world.
Meanwhile,
down in the town,
the Happyfolk slept restlessly, their dreams invaded by shadowy figures
digging away at their souls.
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain.
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
And as the Strangefolk mined deeper
and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear,
bringing with them a cold and
bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey.
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful for,
they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep.
Then there came a sound.
Distant first,
it grew into castrophany so immense it could be heard far away in space.
There were no screams.
There was no time.
The mountain called Monkey had spoken.
There was only fire.
And then,
nothing.
(Singing)
Oh, a little town in U.S.A
The time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you are
But where were you when it all came down on me
Did you call me? No"

Bum, your old hit sound dumb, hold it now, crown 'em
Where you found them at got 'em 'round town
Coulda drowned in and it woulda floated bloated
Voted sugar coated loaded hip shooter

Draw for the poor free coffee at the banks
Hit through the straw none more for me, thanks
That blanks the raw that dang sure stank lit
Sank passed the pit for more hardcore prank spit

Crank it on blast, roll past front street
Blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
These kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

Something is starting today
Where did he go? Why you wanted to be?
Well you know, November has come
When it's gone away

Baha can you dig it like a spigot
My guess is yes you can like, can I kick it, wicked
Liquor shot, if you happy and you know it
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flow it

Broke a pen and I'm in cope hymen
Dope or rhyming all worth it then the hope diamond
Required off the black market or wire tappin'
Couldn't target a jar of spit the rapid fire spark lit

A rapper bug zapper
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or a dapper
Plug yer trap or it's maximum exposure
The beast got family in numbers asking 'em for closure

Aw, send 'em a gun an tell 'em clean it
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong, a billabong
And said, nah, foÂ´ realla the Villain on a Gorilla jawn?

Falling out to go far from the sun

In these demon days it's so cold inside
So hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause mother earth wants us all to leave

When lies become reality you numb yourself with drugs and TV
Pick yourself up it's a brand new day so turn yourself round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself turn yourself around into the sun

In these demon days it's so cold inside
So hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause mother earth wants us all to leave

When lies become reality you numb yourself with drugs and TV
You pick yourself up it's a brand new day so turn yourself round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself, turn yourself around into the sun

To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun
To the sun, to the sun

3512,Pop,Gorillaz,Demon Days ,Clint Eastwood ,"I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long, the future is comin' on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long, the future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on

Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing 'cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare

Intangible, bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view, look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose
All you different crews, chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?

Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional
Mystical maybe, spiritual, hearable
Who appears in you is a clearer view 'cause you're too crazy

Lifeless, to know the definition for what life is
Priceless, for you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin' righteous with one token
Psychic among those, possess you with one go

I ain't happy I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long, the future is comin' on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless but not for long, the future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on

The essence the basics, without it you make it
Allow me to make this, child, like in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sprouting tree

Every child apiece, every cloud you see
You see with your eyes, I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise, from this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucking to your lies

Through russ, though not his muscles but the percussion he provides
With me as a guide, you all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner, so I'm gonna stick around with russ and be a mentor

With a few rhymes so mother fuckers, remember where the thought is
I brought all this, so you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead
No squealing remember, that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long, the future is comin' on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad, I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long, my future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on
My future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on
My future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on
My future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on, is comin' on
My future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on
My future is comin' on
Is comin' on, is comin' on
My future"

You wanna try that
It's like a flashback
So shake your ass crack
I got the balls to
Rock the salsa
Funk the bluesa
Any groove to
Make you move 'cos
Taking you to
Another landscape
Is my mandate
I'm highly animated even though I'm decomposing
So if your feet is frozen I'm a die to see you ropin'

Just twist your hip and do the dip

Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

Gravitational pull
I'll have you making a fool
Out of yourself on the dance floor
Doing back spins, running man, and more
Party down with Vigga and Candor
Coming to the jam
Or look like a landlubber
And do the aqua boogie
Win lots of goodies maybe
Pop a Gucci wallet turntables is talking to me
It's awfully groovy
Seeing all the treasure and the booty

I wanna get down lower than Atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funkier than funkadelic wearin' pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparin' answers
Sharing transcripts while we over here
Dipping and dancin'
Rhythm romancin'
Wallflowers
Giving no act you no
All hours we chillin' and maxin', so
Relaxing
Opposites attracting
I'm a toss my hat in
Floss when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack binge
Jigging and wiggling
Freakin' booties speakin' to the cuties so belligerent
No religion just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn
Negativity we just dead it like dcon
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it respawns

Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

To sing a song that doesn't sing
It grows, you know

Are we the last to get away to some another day?
Or do we know, well, we know
Does it seem to be conveyed that way?

I got it down and wrong I see myself to get
The Lord, seeing all now
Can You take us in the part that coming on
The coldest man doesn't see it's all

We go to the car
I see you walk to the far
And when you get there do you see
You fit the last you need on me

In case you act quite difficult
And your is so weaken with anger and discontent
Some are seeking and searching like me, moi

I'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for retaliation
I change the whole occasion to a pine box six-under
Impulsive, don't ask wild wonder
Orders given to me is 'Strike' and I'm thunder

With lightning fast reflexes on constant alert
From the constant hurt that seems limitless
With no dropping pressure
Seems like everybody's out to test ya
'Til they see your brake

They can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you flipped your soosa
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a 90 days digit and I'm filled with guilt
From things that I've seen

Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert with my street sweeper
The war is over, so said the speaker

With the flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance
Man, all I wanna do is dance

Dance, dance, dance
I need a gun to keep myself from harm"

It's more than I could hope for"
3527,Pop,New Found Glory,Makes Me Sick ,Happy Being Miserable ," Produced By Aaron Sprinkle


[Verse 1]
Carried your burdens in my heart
Sidelined your shallow ways
It just tore me apart
I used to think I was your savior
I see through you now
You indulge in this behavior

[Chorus]
I don’t want to know you
I don’t think we should talk anymore
I want the best for you
But you’re happy being miserable
I don’t want to know you
Or someone who’s so focused on themselves
I’ll save my best for someone else

[Verse 2]
We can debate our separate views
Just look at all your roadblocks
Logic will show you truth
I’ve hid in shadows, wrestled demons
But I won’t deny it because I know how to defeat them

[Chorus]
I don’t want to know you
I don’t think we should talk anymore
I want the best for you
But you’re happy being miserable
I don’t want to know you
Or someone who’s so focused on themselves
I’ll save my best for someone else

[Bridge]
When you throw me under the bus
Back it up and run me over
If I always catch your fall
You will never hit the surface to feel it all
You gotta feel it all

[Chorus]
I don’t want to know you
I don’t think we should talk anymore
I want the best for you
But you’re happy being miserable
I don’t want to know you
Or someone who’s so focused on themselves
I’ll save my best for someone else
I’ll save my best for someone else
(I don’t want to know you, I don’t want to know you)
I’ll save my best for someone else
(I don’t want to know you, I don’t want to know you)
I don’t want to know you
Or someone who’s so focused on themselves
I’ll save my best for someone else"
3528,Pop,New Found Glory,Makes Me Sick ,The Sound of Two Voices ,"[Verse 1]
I must be honest
Under the surface
It grinds like a blender
The sound of two voices
My heart seems to fail me
It put me in a stranger's bed
It hurt who I love the most
I'll never trust it again

[Chorus]
That's why I don't want what I want
'Cause what I want, it just might kill me
And I won't think of my needs
'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me

[Verse 2]
Envy is endless
I used to put mistakes up on a board
Compare how mine sticks
Next to the rest of the worlds'
That got me nowhere but miles from changing
Now I've got deep stains
And bleach won't erase them

[Chorus]
That's why I don't want what I want
'Cause what I want, it just might kill me
And I won't think of my needs
'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me

[Bridge]
Call me on everything
'Cause I can't see how it looks from your perspective
Call me on everything 'cause I can't help myself
And I need your protection from me
I lose every time
I lose every time
I lose every time
You think you're inspiring
Posting slogans on a photo of the sky
You're letting sleeping dogs lie
It's not so simple as
Do what makes you happy
If that's the same thing
That will destroy me

[Chorus]
That's why I don't want what I want
'Cause what I want, it just might kill me
And I won't think of my needs
'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me
I must be honest
(For me)
Under the surface
It grinds like a blender
(I know there's never enough for me)
The sound of two voices
My heart seems to fail me
(For me)
It put me in a stranger's bed
It hurt who I love the most
(What I need, I know there's never enough for me)
I'll never trust it again"
3529,Pop,New Found Glory,Makes Me Sick ,Blurred Vision ,"[Verse 1]
When we first me, I doubted myself
Could someone love to the level you do?
Or are you just excited for a fresh start?
Had reservations, I was dumb to assume
But it's all that I knew
It's all that I knew
Had blurred vision from all my head wounds
A victim of my own bitterness
A life I almost missed
I kick myself when I think of it

[Chorus]
I'm giving up love
I'm giving up love
You're the one, love
You're the one, love

[Verse 2]
When I think back, I still get a feeling
I'm so ashamed of all the time that it took
For me to open my eyes
You brought me back when I was lost and confused
But it's all that I knew
It's all that I knew
Had blurred vision from all my head wounds
A victim of my own stubbornness
A life I almost missed
I curse myself when I think of it

[Chorus]
I'm giving up love
I'm giving up love
You're the one, love
You're the one, love
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one, love
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one, love
I'm giving up love
I'm giving up love

[Bridge]
There's no grass greener on the other side
I planted my roots deep
This is for life
If there comes a time where your leaves might die
I'll water them
I'll water them for you
I'll water them

[Chorus]
I'm giving up love
I'm giving up love
You're the one, love
You're the one, love
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one, love
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one, love
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one, love
You're the one
You're the one, love
You're the one, love
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one, love
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one, love
I'm giving up love
I'm giving up love"

You're speaking the loudest
But you'll fall the hardest
'Cause you know you're just flesh and blood
Like all of us
You're speaking the loudest
You'll fall the hardest
'Cause you know what you're doing
When no one's looking

[Verse 1]
State your case
Your voice proud and bold
You lost soul
Dead to your own ways
On your pedestal
Your pat yourself on your own back
You tie bricks to your legs
Who are you to make demands?
You can't even shake my hand

[Chorus]
You're speaking the loudest
But you'll fall the hardest
'Cause you know you're just flesh and blood
Like all of us
You're speaking the loudest
You'll fall the hardest
'Cause you know what you're doing
When no one's looking

[Verse 2]
No one's safe
We all fall victim to our own ways
Why don't you start there?
At your age, I don't see bags yet under your eyes
You haven't reached the hardest part
Who are you to make demands?
You can't even shake my hand

[Chorus]
You're speaking the loudest
But you'll fall the hardest
'Cause you know you're just flesh and blood
Like all of us
You're speaking the loudest
You'll fall the hardest

Who are you to make demands?
You can't even shake my hand
You're speaking the loudest
You're speaking the loudest
You're preaching the loudest
But you'll fall the hardest
'Cause you know what you're doing
When no one's looking
When no one's looking
You're speaking the loudest
But you'll fall the hardest
You're speaking the loudest
But you'll fall the hardest"
3531,Pop,New Found Glory,Makes Me Sick ,Barbed Wire ,"[Verse 1]
We made blood boil
Turned many eyes red
They felt the earth shake the second our lips connected
We built our own house
It got rat infested
Set it on fire 'cause everything's replaceable
But you and our memories
No one can touch them

[Chorus]
Because we're barbed wire
Two strands twisted to one
Razor sharp
No one will ever touch us
Yeah, we're barbed wire
Two strands twisted to one
Razor sharp
No one will ever touch us

[Verse 2]
Tripped over ourselves
We slept in the gutter
We rolled around in broken glass
Self-inflicted, but we had each other
To stop the infection from spreading throughout all our veins
With you, through the hardest moments
No one can steal them

[Chorus]
Because we're barbed wire
Two strands twisted to one
Razor sharp
No one will ever touch us
Yeah, we're barbed wire
Two strands twisted to one
Razor sharp
No one will ever touch us

[Bridge]
Got enough in our lives
Got enough, got enough in our lives to worry about
To worry about
Been through enough in our lives
Been through enough, through enough in our lives
Don't worry about
Don't worry about everyone else
With you, through the hardest moments
No one can steal them

[Chorus]
We're barbed wire
Two strands twisted to one
Razor sharp
No one will ever touch us
Yeah, we're barbed wire
Two strands twisted to one
Razor sharp
No one will ever touch us
No one will ever touch us

Got enough in our lives
Got enough, got enough in our lives to worry about
To worry about
No one will ever touch us"
3532,Pop,New Found Glory,Makes Me Sick ,Short and Sweet ,"[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make it easy
Because I haven't had much time to think
And figure out clever words to sing
Accurate enough for you
I'm gonna dumb this down
'Cause it's not even about me
I'll shout it out even though they'll say they've heard this all before

[Chorus]
I don't deserve someone as beautiful as you
I don't deserve much of anything
I don't deserve someone as beautiful as you
Forgiving me and giving me as much as you do

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna take it easy
And not get to many details
Some moments better kept for you and I
But I'll keep up the pace
Not trying to overcompensate with savvy lines
It's as real as it can get
It's as real as it can get

[Chorus]
I don't deserve someone as beautiful as you
I don't deserve much of anything
I don't deserve someone as beautiful as you
Forgiving me and giving me as much as you do

I don't deserve much of anything
I don't deserve someone as beautiful as you
Forgiving me and giving me as much as you do

As much as you do
As much as you do
I don't deserve much of anything"
3533,Pop,New Found Glory,Makes Me Sick ,The Cheapest Thrill ,"[Verse 1]
I was a teenager, delusional
With such an awkward build
That's why the first time she sent me a look
I swore she was my world
A week later, got cheated on
A pay-by-hour hotel
I guess she thought that's what my future's worth
A twenty dollar bill
I damn the world, shooting fire from my eyes
But behind them I was burning
Now I'm the lie

[Chorus]
I'm the cheapest thrill
I'm the cheapest thrill
And everyone can tell that I'm the cheapest thrill
And I can barely stand myself

[Verse 2]
Clearly I was crazy
The first to give advice
Played it up like I was noble
But I was feeding my own pride
The lengths I'd go for a fix
Tacky charm got me far
Must have hurt so many feelings
While stabbing my own heart
I damn the world, shooting fire from my eyes
But behind them I was burning
Now I'm the lie

[Chorus]
I'm the cheapest thrill
I'm the cheapest thrill
And everyone can tell that I'm the cheapest thrill
And I can barely stand myself

[Bridge]
Suddenly I can see through my own eyes again
But I don't like what I'm feeling
You can't help your thoughts
But you can change your actions
If I don't I'll be consumed

[Chorus]
Now I'm the cheapest thrill
I'm the cheapest thrill
And everyone can tell that I'm the cheapest thrill
And I can barely stand myself
I know now I'm not going back
I know my own worth now
(And I can barely stand myself)
I know now I'm not going back
I know my own worth now
(And I can barely stand myself)
I know now I'm not going back
I know my own worth now
(I'm the cheapest thrill)
I'm the cheapest thrill"
3534,Pop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Fire Away ,"[Verse 1]
Honey load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I’m a shelter for heartaches that don’t have a home
Choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I’ll say is

[Chorus]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I’m not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

[Verse 2]
Well, I wish I could say
That I’ve never been here before
But you know and I know
That I’ll always come back for more
Your love might be my damnation
But I’ll cry to my grave

[Chorus] x2"
3535,Pop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Traveller ,"I see the sunrise creeping in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she's gone again

I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rolling till I'm in the dirt
‘Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you honey, I don't know
Where I'm going but I've got to go
‘Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turning on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rolling till I'm in the dirt
‘Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you honey, I don't know
Where I'm going but I've got to go
‘Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rolling till I'm in the dirt
‘Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you honey, I don't know
Where I'm going but I've got to go
‘Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller"

When The Stars Come OutChris Stapleton

I was looking for a change of scene
You were looking at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So, we packed up everything we had
Running on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
Trying to find salvation in that city limit sign

And one of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Everybody's, somebody, someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's trying to find a way
To say, what needs saying
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Begging angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playing
You and I, we're gamblers holding cards that we can't see
And I'm betting on you, you're betting on me

Down on the freeway, the sun is out of sight
And I got a feeling tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night"
3537,Pop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Tennessee Whiskey ,"Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
‘Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
{Break}
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
Honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as sweet as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee Whiskey
Tennessee Whiskey
You're as sweet as Tennessee Whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey"
3538,Pop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Sometimes I Cry ,"There are days that I can walk around like I'm alright,
And I pretend to wear a smile on my face,
And I could keep the pain from comin' out of my eyes,
But sometimes, sometimes,

Sometimes I cry,
Cry,
Sometimes I cry,
When I can't do nothing else.

Everybody keeps tellin' me to move on,
Oh but I can't seem to go anywhere without you,
Cause ever since, and every single night you been gone,
Sometimes, sometimes,

Sometimes I cry,
Cry,
Sometimes I cry,
When I can't do nothing else

Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else."
3539,Pop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,The Devil Named Music ,"[Verse 1]
We drove all night to Billings, Montana
Flew into Utah, slept there all day
I can’t remember stopping in Denver
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play

[Chorus 1]
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

[Verse 2]
Now I sold my soul a long time ago
I put it in a six string and a sad melody
And I’m sometimes a winner, most times a loser
If the crowd gets into it, it’ll all feel the same way to me

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]"
3540,Pop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Was It 26 ,"[Verse 1]
Livin' hard was easy when I was young and bullet-proof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had blood shot eyes at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
Cause anything worth havin', I’d just lose anyway
Friends worried about me they’d asked if I was sick
Thought I wouldn’t die at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Chorus]
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six

[Verse 2]
Met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty, college grad
I thought my luck was changin' but then it all went bad
I guess I fell in love with her all it took was just one kiss
But then she said goodbye at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption, I guess only time will tell
I have faith and the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Chorus]"
3541,Pop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Might As Well Get Stoned ,"[Verse 1]
Well, she said, she didn’t love me
And kicked me out the door
Now I’m livin’ in one room
And sleepin’ on the floor
Think I’m gonna kick my boots off
And put some music on
And since I’m all alone
I might as well get stoned

[Chorus]
I might as well get stoned
Get it off my mind
Ain’t got a thing to do
All I’ve got is time
The bottle’s all I’ve had to be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey’s gone
I might as well get stoned

[Verse 2]
Now every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brother’s gone
Another mother cries
Now I know they’ve got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish they’d all come home
So, we could all get stoned

[Chorus]"
3542,Pop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Daddy Doesn't Pray Anymore ,"[Chorus]
Daddy doesn’t pray anymore
I guess he’s finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn’t pray anymore

[Verse 1]
I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children
And the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said, grace

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There was a time when we didn’t get along
Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night
I’d hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God’s word
We sang his favorite hymn but daddy didn’t make a sound
This afternoon we’ll lay him in the ground
But daddy doesn’t pray anymore
I guess he’s finally walking with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn’t pray anymore"
3543,Pop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,More Of You ,"[Verse 1]
When I think of you and the first time we met
And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
My heart took me over and gave me no choice
And right then I knew

[Chorus]
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I’ve ever been
From the moment you wake me up
Till you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

[Verse 2]
When I look at you now that years have gone by
I think of the memories that time can’t erase
And all of the smiles that you’ve brought to my face
You’re love’s been so true

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When I leave this earth you’ll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know you’ll be there
And I’ll thank the Lord for the love that we share
You’re heaven to me

Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you"
3544,Pop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Nobody To Blame ,"[Verse 1]
She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Chorus]
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Verse 2]
She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I can’t even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Chorus]"
3545,Pop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Whiskey And You ,"[Verse 1]
There’s a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it’s empty so right now I don’t feel a thing
And I’ll be hurting when I wake up on the floor
But I’ll be over it by noon
That’s the difference between whiskey and you
Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain’t a problem, they’ll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, that’s something I can’t buy
There ain’t a thing that I can do
That’s the difference between whiskey and you

[Chorus]
One’s the devil, one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ain’t both the same
But one’s a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one’s the long gone bitter truth
That’s the difference between whiskey and you

[Verse 2]
I’ve got a problem but it ain’t like what you think
I drink because I’m lonesome and I’m lonesome ‘cause I drink
But if I don’t break down and bring it on myself
It’ll hit out of the blue
That’s the difference between whiskey and you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ah, that’s the difference between whiskey and you"
3546,Pop,Chris Stapleton ,Traveller ,Parachute ,"[Verse 1]
Street lights along the highway
Throwing shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turning
To the rhythm of a broken heart

[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it’s raining
You only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

[Verse 2]
There’s a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

If you think you’re going down
Just know I will be around

in an outlaw state of mind
I got friends that know how to have a good time

3548,Pop,Justin Hurwitz,La La Land (Original Motion Picture Score) ,City Of Stars May Finally Come True [feat. Ryan Gosling] ,"[Sebastian's Verse: Ryan Gosling & (Emma Stone)]
City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
There's so much that I can't see
Who knows?
I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
(That now our dreams
They've finally come true)

[Mia's Verse: Emma Stone & (Ryan Gosling)]
City of stars
Just one thing everybody wants
There in the bars
And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
(A rush)
A glance
(A touch)
A dance

[Duet: Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone]
A look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and send it reeling
A voice that says, I'll be here
And you'll be alright

I don't care if I know
Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart

[Outro: Ryan Gosling & (Emma Stone)]
Think I want it to stay

City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
(You never shined so brightly)"

3550,Pop,Soundtrack,Fifty Shades Darker ,What Is Love? ,"Does anyone really know how to love?
Does anyone really feel what they dreamt of?

Or is it all a puzzle maze
But we never actually walk out the other side

We go round and round and round
Taking wrong times
And clinging to the edges of ourselves

What is this thing that we called love?
What is this thing that I dreamt of?
What is this thing that with such a rush?
What is this thing that we called love?

What is love?
Oh, what is love?

You think you felt it all
But then it hits
A comet from above
Crashes into your lips

And suddenly you find yourself
Thinking of things you never thought of before

And something in you changes
You can't think of anything else
Apart from the person that left a rose by your door

What is this thing that we called love?
What is this thing that I dreamt of?
What is this thing that with such a rush?
What is this thing that we called love?

What is love?
Oh, what is love?
What is love?
Oh, what is love?

What is this thing that we called love?
What is this thing that I dreamt of?
What is this thing that with such a rush?
What is this thing that we called love?

What is this thing that we called love?
What is this thing that we called love?"

I've been dying for you baby

I look around for the friends that have gone and I’m
Reminded that it’s all just a fantasy
But we get to choose what we wanna believe
And I wanna believe that there’s something more
Another level to the dream, right through the door
But right now’s for real and it’s fading fast

I'm smiling looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back
To when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
Had the guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sipping on the local's spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time

Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the (?) and the game

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had the guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sipping on the local's spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses rained on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

When I think about those summer night
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now
Time, time, time"

You pray more than you breathe
And you just wanna fall to pieces
And nights, those 2 AM calls
Where dreams become walls
And you just need a break
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

There'll be times when someone you know
Becomes someone you knew
But you'd do anything to change it
And words you wanna take back
But you know you can't
When the page just won't turn
And it still hurts
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

Oh, when you need somebody
When you need somebody right now
You're where I'll be
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
Break on me
Break on me, baby"

And maybe I'm crazy

Wish I could say it don't get to me
But it does...
And I know I probably think about you way too much 
But that's because
That could still be us

I went down to the river bank
Looked in the water and saw your face
That small town, summer wind
Whispers on my mistakes

Remember those nights in your backyard 
Making each other shake
And lately it kills me
And nothin' can fill me

Cause that could still be us...

I go by this night time park
And replay all again

What would've been
We should've been 
What was

And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16

Hey, hey
Everything I needed
That's right

I'm Mark Twain on the Mississippi
I'm Hemingway with a shot of whiskey
I'm a TV dinner on a tray trying to figure out the Wheel of Fortune
I'm a Texaco star, I'm a Gibson guitar
I'm still a teenage kid trying to go too far
I'm a jukebox waiting in a neon bar for a quarter

And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe in the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on the boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16

I spent a lot of years running from believing, looking for another way to save my soul
The longer I live, the more I see it: there's only one way home

And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe in the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on the boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe in the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on the boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16

(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16)
Everything I needed
(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16)
Everything I needed
(John Cougar, John Deere, John 3: 16)
That's right"
