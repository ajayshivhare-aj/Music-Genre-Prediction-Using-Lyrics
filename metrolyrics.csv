0,"25 years of my life and still
I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that meansAnd so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I, I am feeling... a little peculiar.And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?

Kitties is cool and all that

See, a cat got a little more strength
So they can take a little more length
You gotta feed a kitty real slow
But a cat can take a little bit mo'
So lay on down on the silk
So you can get a bowl of this milk
Then let's do it like dogs
I wanna see ya climb the walls
And once I get in them guts
I'ma do that straight cat strut
So please don't make a brother beg
To get inbetween them legs

I was visiting Atlanta when I met this strip dancer
now love was the question and shorty was the answer
she was dancing on the stage in her lingerie
and I think I heard teh DJ call her Sauncerea
body route around the pole on her hands and her knees
18 half black and half vietnamese
looking like she taste better than Koloa and milk
with the dirty red complexion skin smoother than silk
so young and so tender she made all me a stare
getting paid to make love to a kick in the snap
as I sat up in the cut just for waiting my chance
to solicite Sauncerea for a private dance
yo I could still remember seeing days in the made
wishing she would just hurry up and enter the stage
so this hundred I been saving for my P.I.P.
I spent slowly and Sauncerea would dance for me
with a body flowing slow like a smooth poet
it tosses gave my mind like some cool more wet
and decided we together like the birds and the bees
a match made in heaven like some O's and D's
no I never met a girl so sexy and fine
she can take a man's money especially mine
and on top of all that plunk control his mind
with the way she made her dairyiare roll and grind
plus I never thought I answer an executive club
see a sexy strip dancer and get expensive with love
cuz to love someone you don't know it really ain't smart
but in certain situations you just follow your heart
cuz in reality she's probably got a man of her own
but I could fantasize as long as I got to for a song
and 10 dollars is a small price to pay when you love
a sexy strip dancer that you met in a club

they turned dollars into dimes and dimes to dubs
mesmorized by your brothas when I enter the club
and though you strip for tips I place no one above
my sexy strip dancer doing strip club love
and no matter what they say I'm gonna love ya right
even if the love only last one night
she's just the cream of the crop and I place no one above
my booty shaking beauty doing strip club love[69 Boyz]
girl if your beauty was a dollar you'd be richer than Trump
cuz you better than a supersport apolloing home
if I could choose between the chance to put the ring on your hand
or a platinum presidential with baguess in the band
ain't no choice I'd rather have you than the finest of jewels
for you I travel over heart throws minus the shoes
rules there ain't none cuz I'm caught in the mix
like a herowine junky shaking needing a fix
and everytime I see you dance I get lace in my viens
an all type of loss again erasing my brain
cuz my heart says love but my mind say lust
and it's hard to decifer what emotions to trust
cuz if I trust an inner man then it may just work
but theres a 50-50 chance I could end up hurt
and I could trust in my flesh but if I move to fast
my first time could end up being my last
so I ask what kind of playa like myself fill your head with a word
or tell you anything that you ain't possibly heard
when I'm already knowing each and everynight
you hear game from the guys and girls are light
it's just a thought but maybe all my wish would thought she be bitch
cuz a girl like yourself is probably already hitched
it happen but you just dancing trying to get you a lick
or maybe you in love with the attention you get
either way Sauncerea the choice is yours to make
and everything your momma gave you girl is yours to shake
and you can shake it till you break it or the cows come home
or till all these other niggas here cash is gone
and when we finally get the chance to speak as a pair
and the beeper number is all you can spell thats cool

Verse 1: Thrill Da Playa
Hello?
(Hey baby, what you doin'?) Playin' tetherball
And eatin' cream out the middle of some Oreos
I meant to call you back last night
But I was watchin a video of an Evander Holyfield fight
Next time you see your friend Michelle,
Tell her if she ain't fake, one of my boys wanna yell
Anyway, that's enough of that
When we gon' hook up, so I can pack the kitty-cat?
Oh, now you wanna play the switcheroo?
Well call me back when you gon' let me hit the coochy-coo
Just because I play the Babyface
Don't mean that I'm a punk that won't hang up in a lady's face
Oh, I thought you might change your mind
'Cause a fella like myself, I must admit, is hard to find
You coulda stuck with your ex-man
Just to chit-chat and talk about wedding plans
'Cause I ain't gonna talk respectfully
I talk reality, and how we can fulfill your needs sexually
The kinda stuff that'll make you wonder
And callin' me is cheaper than a 976 number
And I ain't tryin' to run game
I belong to you, so I ain't tryin' to prove a damn thing!
So we can do whatever, but now, all I
Wanna know is, when is we gon' get together?

I hope that we can get together soon (3x)
In my room, yeh, drinkin' a bottle of brewww ...Verse 2: Thrill Da Playa
So when you gonna let me get ya hot?
We'll get some wine, food, and a room at the Mariott
What? Filet mignon and Parignon?
Well I was thinkin' more Dom and lime potato chips and (?)
Baby, I ain't bein' cheap!
But if we gon' be workin' out, we don't need to have too much to eat
I'm sure you need some work on your thighs
And for sure my third leg could use a little exercise
Hold on a second, hon ---
{speaking off the phone}
Man, can't you see I'm on the phone, runnin' game, tryin' to get me some?
What? If you're gonna get perverty,
Then make sure you bring back a freaky-deaky friend for me!
{he comes back on the phone}
I'm back, baby, sorry 'bout that thing
But my boys let me know I was next on the cellular game
But anyway, onto bigger things, and better things
Like kitty-cat and ding-a-ling
I really hope you're hearing me, and at the same time,
I hope you ain't gettin' the wrong idea of me
I'd love to take you to a picture show
But it's cheaper to stay home and watch it all on HBO
'Cause if we home and we take it,
We'll get the hot-buttered corn, and watch the movie naked
So baby, let's go to my room
And I hope we can get together real soonChorus, repeat till fade

saw a real fine cutie with some hazel eye
sitting with her friends eating shrimp and fries

And I knew I'd be a hustler, even when I was in kindergarten
Feelin' on the teachers and givin' 'em looks
And steady takin' all the other kids' coloring books
My momma used to try to make me study my work
But I was busy chasin' girls, gettin' under they skirts
And though she raised me the best she could,
Them whippin's ain't done me no good
And sure, I could play ball like the rest of the guys,
But yo, I always had this fear of gettin' paralyzed
And sellin' drugs at the time was the easy way
The easy work, easy women plus the easy pay
It had me feelin' like I would do whatever it takes
To have a car and a woman in a couple of states
Cause I'm a professional, and you couldn't knock it
Because I had to keep some money in my pocket

(Rasta chorus)Verse 2
The Rottweiler:
When I was comin' up and runnin' up,
The hoochies in my hood never took time, so I took mine
And I thought it would change, and when I got older
They just got colder, and gave me the cold shoulder
But now them hoes wanna skeeze me
Just because they see my face on TV, uhh
Them hoes be buggin'; they come a-dime-a-dozen
I'm even doin' it with my own cousin
I got hoes 'cause I'm so rich, nigga
Never get played and laid by no trick, nigga
They only speak 'cause a brother done peeped strong
I muss my hair like Fred and get the hell on
I gots no love for them hoes, and if I did it'd be a drama,
'Cause, trick, I only love my momma
And never have I sold a yard
But I'd do it if times got hard
'Cause it's survival of the fittestThrill Da Playa:
Comin' up daily, gettin' richer than rich
And all the fellas in the hood just itchin' to snitch
But I got my stuff runnin' so tight and legit
That the fans can't even make a spirit to stick
So yo, they can go and find another dealer to fade;
I got a business in my name, and my taxes is paid
They only mad 'cause they bussin' they chops
To say that I'm a millionaire because I'm cuttin' them rocks
They can't *f**k* with that, and even when they think they can,
I got a set-up so they only get the metal man!
I can't see bein' a letter to them
And locked up just because I'm doin' better than them
I tried the right way, but they kept ignorin' me
Saw opportunity, and I went for it, G!
It was smooth and the feds couldn't match me
But now that I'm legit, yo, I know they'll never catch me
It's survival of the fittest(Rasta chorus)Verse 3
The Rottweiler:
Uhhh, and ow that I'm straight with the law,
I'm makin' more money than I ever saw
But still, my 9's what I'm alive by
I'm never slippin' to be a victim of a drive-by
But it's still kind of crazy
If I spend two seconds with a girl, she's claimin' she's havin' a baby
And all my girlfriends are black, and they act rude
But if I dated another color, they'd get an attitude
And my moms ... yo, bless her soul
Alive, and bustin' her ass before 25
Got a brother in a rage, uh, she ain't a minimum woman,
So why the hell she makin' minimum wage?
I try to give her money, but she won't take it
She says she hates it; she doesn't like the way I make it
I thank the Lord I'm alive. All I have to do is survive
'Cause it's survival of the fittestThrill Da Playa:
I know the feelin', I can keep my poise
I got beepers, and all types of digital toys
And I know they think that I am sellin' dope
And wanna keep me underneath the microscope
So they can try and take what's mine
But I'll burn it to shreds, before they get one dime
And to them, it's a hurtin' fact
Because it's all insured, so yo, I'm gonna get it right back
And yeah, they lookin' like dummies
They waste they time, plus they waste they taxpayers' money
So put away your house-raidin' tactics,
Shotguns, ski-masks, and windbreaker jackets
'Cause ain't no doors gettin' kicked down
And if it is ... then I suggest you skip town
Becuase my lawyer's so good, I hope you're packed up;
In the morning, you'll be sleepin' in Alaska
It's survival of the fittest(Rasta chorus)

Living in this hell
It's time to make my way
Into the world I knew
and to take back all of these times
That I gave in to youLately I'm so tired of waiting for you

Let me be myself
So I can shine with my own light
And let me be myself
For a while, if you don't mind

Cause I'm not doing so good without you
The things I thought you'd never know about me
Were the things I guess you always understoodSo how could I have been so blind for all these years?
Guess I only see the truth through all this fear
And living without youAnd everything I have in this world
And all that I'll ever be
It could all fall down around me.
Just as long as I have you

I can't take another day without you
Cause baby, I could never make it on my own
I've been waiting so long, just to hold you
And to be back in your arms where I belongSorry I can't always find the words to say
But everything I've ever known gets swept away
Inside of your love?And everything I have in this world
And all that I'll ever be
It could all fall down around me.
Just as long as I have you
Right here by me.As the days grow long I see
That time is standing still for me
When you're not hereSorry I can't always find the words to say

If I can be strong enough to throw away these weak pieces of me
I've gone to sleep in heaven
Only to wake in hell
If I'm gonna make it through this now







 




Then I'll have to save myself
'Cause...
Tomorrow will be a brand new day

Underneath the blood stained gownHe thinks about that little girl

And wonders what if that was my little girl

Something in me
Something in me dies

We'll be the ones who can say we don't need themCome on, come on
Let's enjoy the ride
Cause we only know what's inside of these lights
And I wanna know what's on the other side
And we'll keep on going until there's only us and the nightSome people pay to make us believe the things that I say
But I don't
What they don't know is we got so much more than we show
They only want us to think that they're stronger
Now we don't have to pretend any longer

Kiss me while I'm still alive
Kill me while I kiss the sky

Live and let me learn
Now I'll follow my own way, and I'll
Live on to another damn day
Freedom carries sacrifice, remember when this was my life
Looking forward, not behind
Everybody's got to cross that line
Free me now to give me a place,
Keep me caged and free the beast
Falling faster, time goes by, fear is
Not seen through these eyes
What there was will never be, now
I'm blind and cannot see
Kiss me while I'm still alive
Kill me while I kiss the sky
Let me die on my own terms, let me

Pussy niggas love sneak dissing 'til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house, keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar, thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playing Nintendo, I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Pantherville
Eighth grade started playin' football, then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out, nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016 and I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick, I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissing on twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'till a nigga get killed
'till a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one, Savage I ain't even hating""
So what's up with all that instagram shit?
""Savage I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin', bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

Cooking up dope in Givenchys, all my niggas counting benjis
Pull up on you with the sticks nigga, we gon' handle business
I know a lot of niggas out here say they worth a mill ticket
I guess everybody rich, you a goddamn liar
Took the stand on your right hand man, so you had to die
Lost a lot of my real niggas so I had to cry
21 and that sex money what I live by
Glock 40 with the 30 round and a red dot
Young nigga went from hotboxing to a trap spot
Niggas clutching on the choppers every time the fuckin' door knock
Santan molly that'll make your fucking heart stop
Feds taking pictures every time the fucking car stop
Auntie hit the dope, she said it make her fucking jaw lock
Stray bullets hitting kids while they playing hop scotch
16 and pregnant ,told her momma and a fucking tear drop
And that's my soda, that's my stove and that's my pot

And I slept with rats and roaches

Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should've trusted youHoe stab a nigga in the back like the streets do
Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you
Niggas quick to say they loyal to you, they be see-through

Fuck the chatter, he gon' tattle, put 'em on the platter
Snakes plotting on my downfall like I'm hearing rattle
(That fuck nigga gone flop man
21 ain't even no real nigga, fuck that nigga)
We sticking to the G code, nigga we ain't beefin' over freak ho's
I hit her on the D low, yeah she like my steelo
That nigga think that he a bullet, don't like credit, Deebow
30-round hangin' out the big Glock
Nigga, no six shots, shootin' 'til the clip stops
You a lil' cat, I'm a big dog
Nigga, when we pullin' up the stick's out
Too much money got 'em pissed off

Fuck a niggas bitch to get a kick out it

The kicked me outta middle school and sent me to the house
We 'bout that gunplay, nigga, motherfuck 'yo count

Wash away the pain with the soda
Tryna make the work double up, I beat the bowl up
Tryna make the work double up to meet my quota
.40 on my hip, you know that chopper on my shoulder
I remember hard times when it was no love
I remember fast money and them slow bucks
I got all this gold on me like the gold rush
VVS's drippin' on me it's a hotel
I remember shoot outs niggas, broad day
Remember when I hit that nigga with the K
Niggas ain't loyal, nigga they'll betray you
Shoot 'em in the temple, give that nigga a fade
My dog got life and shit ain't been the same
All I got is money bags on my brain
Go hard in the booth and buy another chain
I do it for the money nigga, not the fame

Every day that I'm alive, I'ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain't no way I'ma switchBreak it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it downPenitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement
And that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beatsHow much money you got? (A lot)

Some niggas make millions
Other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I was never one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak
For itself, but the people want everything else
Ok, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these
Rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he sent me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that
I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is
The greatest revenge, tell all your friends

Lost a few friends chasin' hand money (On God)
Had the same friends when I was bummy (Straight up)
They should've went and did stand-up
'Cause when the money come, niggas act funny (True)
Crocodile wrist band, 21 Dundee
Yo' bitch skate so fast to the dick
That she'd even go and get a job at Sonic (On God)
Made it from the bottom, I'm a star (21)
Playin' with the stick like a guitar (21)
Why you got a 12 car garage? (Why?)
'Cause I bought six new cars (No lie)
I remember times was dark (I do)
Now I'm backstage with a bar (Big dog)
Couldn't pay the light bill, it was dark (Yeah)
Now I can shine in the dark (On God)
Lost a couple friends
I ain't even really mad though (On God)
I ain't even really mad though (21)
Hard to tell the real from fake
'Cause nowadays, they got masks on
Who gon' be around when the fame and the cash gone?
I lost all my friends countin' bands in a Lambo truck
VVSs on me, fightin' icy like a hockey puck
If she wanna dance, let her dance, watch her pick it up
I don't need no friends, what's a friend if it ain't no trust?

Pulled up with no army, just the guap and I'm spendin' it
No, no, never lendin' it, that's all for me
I stay greedy with the dollar, givin' no 'pologies
All these mans with they fuckin' hands out
Tryna spare some
I don't never stress, no, I got plenty peso

Everybody says I went ghost, jump in my Phantom
Paparazzi always tryna press up on me
Ever since I blew up, I don't know nobody (Know nobody)
Yeah, I blew 80 bands only for you to leave
Hey, I know somewhere that my mama prayin' for me (For me)I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe (For me)

Lot of model bitches check for me
Nigga, don't check for me 'less you got checks for me
I kept a stick like a hobo, no checkin' me
Way back when D-Lo had the spot in Trestletree
So many hoes had to get a vasectomy
She left her body home and brought her neck to me
I did a walk-through, they sent a jet to me
Y'all niggas show price less than my travel fee
One of my arms worth a ticket
Watch so much that a car came with it
Back in the day I used to rob with no mask on
Shit on my wrist, I woulda killed the whole house for

Caught me with a deuce five, mama kicked my ass, bro

Every day that I'm alive, I'ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain't no way I'ma switchBreak it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it downPenitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement
And that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beatsHow much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)

How many times did she cry? (A lot)
How many chances she done gave you?
Fuck around with these thots (A lot)Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six hour drive, six and a half
Before I left I stopped by to
See my nigga 21 in the studio
Yeah, two of his kids with him
Right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like thatQuestion
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah)
Everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions
Other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I was never one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak
For itself, but the people want everything else
Ok, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these
Rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he sent me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that
I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is
The greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission
Cementin' the spot as the greatest who did it
Before it all ends, niggaHow much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)

How could you forget the times we've shared
Don't throw our love away

Sure as, the path that's been chosen, cannot be changed
In my life's destination, I searched for the explaination
For some kind of reason, for my sorrow and pain
But in my isolation I learned to listen
To be thankful for the love that I'd been givenThis is my journey, journey through life
With every twist and turn I've laughed and cried
As the road unwinds
This is my journey, and I've learned to fight
To make me strong enough, to lift me up, to bring my dreams alive

In my desperation I swore that never again
Would I hear all the laughter of my friends and my family
A million tears that I'd cried then began to dry
In the silence of the night time
I had came to realize
A sweet inspiration filled my horizon
Gave me the heart to go on and never would give inThis is my journey, journey through life
With every twist and turn I've laughed and cried
As the road unwinds
This is my journey, and I've learned to fight
To make me strong enough, to lift me up, to bring my dreams aliveI'm going to love each moment, of every day and night
I'll look back to the past with the sweetest smile
For now I realise, I've been given the key to life
I've been kissed by the angel by my side

Baby don't cry, I can see we've lost the feeling
Won't you open your eyes, and try to find your smile
We've known each other too long, to let it all slip away
When all's said and done, we've said our last goodbye
Baby don't cryBaby, we've been living a lie
And even though it hurts deep inside
I know there can be no, no, no compromise
'Cause too many chances have passed
And if you want a love that can last
Never try to push things too fast
And though I've no regrets
I still recall the night we met
We said that we'd never end, so baby lisenBaby don't cry, I can see we've lost the feeling
Won't you open your eyes, and try to find your smile
We've known each other too long, to let it all slip away
When all's said and done, we've said our last goodbye







 




All the memories we had, I wouldn't change a thing
And with the lights down low, I'm dreaming of what could have been
Even though we've tried so many times before
I'll take one look around, before I close the door
With this one last kiss I know deep down inside
The beginning of the end, the ending of our time
Maybe we could try, but no, it's just too late
Just another cruel twist of fateLooking back through the years
Time has dried all our tears
But all good things must end, oh just listenBaby don't cry, I can see we've lost the feeling
Won't you open your eyes, and try to find your smile
We've known each other too long, to let it all slip away
When all's said and done, we've said our last goodbyeBaby don't cry, I can see we've lost the feeling
Won't you open your eyes, baby don't cry
We've known each other too long, open your eyes and find your smile
When all's said and done, we've said our last goodbyeBaby don't cry, I can see we've lost the feeling
Won't you open your eyes, and try to find your smile
We've known each other too long, we've sad our last goodbye
When all's said and done, we've said our last goodbye

Always fucked up in niggaz bitches all the time

Me, Squeaky, Flex and J, on Saratoga Street
Smokin white boys, bumpin dopefiend beats
Eighty-eight, my pockets wasn't straight, but I was makin it
Niggaz like Lil' Tim was out there ballin sellin cakes n shit
I was right there, on the Mob Circle, writin raps
All about my snaps, tryin to put Ball and G on the map
Nowadays I own my shit and bone bad bitches
Kickin it with rich niggaz in rollers, and candy sixes
Deliverin hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs
Niggaz who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs
Feel my flow, mix it in witcha chronic main
Dawg, I don't know why you tryin to leave this game
State to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make
Writing raps, makin more than them niggaz movin weight
The game been good to me, and I know that muhfucka bless you
Thanks for passin game, now let's get out here and make this lootToo, Eightball, MJG







 




I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
We some presidential players, with money by the layers
Ain't nuthin you broke ass niggaz do that can fade us
I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
and meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapesTwo: MJG, TooI had to sacrifice, get things right
In this rap life, I paid my dues
Learn how to crawl, before I walk
Then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tryin crime, but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Gettin eyes scarred, bein weak one time ya hard
It can only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my peer pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin fool
Hell this music thing is all I got, I ain't makin straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing
Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons
My first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady
was rappin, sweet lyrics, I love you, my baby
MJG, what you see, on TV, is fame
But the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this gameI won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
I make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
I live the fast life of a MC
and I sell a lot of records makin pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make ten G's
Fuck til the mornin, sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always, get my dick sucked on the highwayThree: Eightball, MJGMy way (pimp til I dieee) fuck a hoe
Unless that hoe is breakin me off some dough, to hit the studio
Blowin, niggaz ain't knowin, how far this shit is goin
I wrote all my shit, but niggaz always talkin bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them, real niggaz stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money, and try my best to fuck all these hoes
Friend or foe, a bitch or hoe, rich or po'
Eightball got flow, MJGHere comes the one they call the P-I, M-P, never will retire
The tree-high, green leaf, helps me to get higher
Eightball and MJG, Too, we all must be
the pimps of the industry, shit people pretend to be
Fuck so why should we, settle down
Leave the kitchen put the kettles down
Stop from fillin all you hoes
Give up the life of trues and vogues
Hell no, it ain't gon' happen, this shit too deep
So I hooked up with my comrades so we can all get rich, niggaYea yea, one time, for your motherfuckin mind
Pimp shit bitch
Eightball and MJG, now what you weigh me
Dawg in the house, slammin Cadillac do's, pimpin hoes
Nuthin but the real shit, nine-eight, for these tricks it's too late
It's that old school pimpin all the way from Memphis, to Oakland
Straight smokin baby, fryin em up fat
Atlanta to Houston, we still doin it like this
Yea, New York to L.A.
Beyitch!
Hah, that's right, Space Age forever, nigga
T-Mix on the funk
Dangerous Music, uhh
Suave House
I love that!

Last night I was so scared I couldn't close my eyes
You still live in me
Some how I made it through the night
Rescued by the break of day, once again
I know someone's in your heart, it's pulling me apart
But I guess I'm the one to blame (it's so hard)
And it's so hard (so hard) holding back the tears now you've dissapeared
How I long to hold you near

Oh I should've been the one who's with you now
Should've been the one that's feeling proud
I failed you now
Oh I should've read the signs in your eyes
Should've had the sense to realise
I've lost you now
I see you, laughing out loud standing in the crowd
The same crowd I used to know
But it's too late now to change anything
I've lost everything
Gotta learn to let you go
Chorus
I should've been the light in your eyes (should've been the light)
Should've been the fire in your smile (should've been the fire)
I should've been your spirit and your guide
I wonder do you think of me? (do you think of me?)
Maybe you shed a tear for me (shed a tear for me)
I realise I paid the price but nothing's gonna change the way I fell for
you
Oh I should've been the one who's with you now
Should've been the one who's feeling proud
Girl I've failed you now
Should've read the signs in your eyes
Should've had the sense to realise
I've lost you now
I know I let you down, baby had to fool around
Oh I should've been the one who's with you now
Should've been the one who's feeling proud
I failed you now
I should've read the signs, baby should've realised
